= camel-smpp-kafka-connector sink configuration

When using camel-smpp-kafka-connector as sink make sure to use the following Maven dependency to have support for the connector:

[source,xml]
----
<dependency>
  <groupId>org.apache.camel.kafkaconnector</groupId>
  <artifactId>camel-smpp-kafka-connector</artifactId>
  <version>x.x.x</version>
  <!-- use the same version as your Camel Kafka connector version -->
</dependency>
----

To use this Sink connector in Kafka connect you'll need to set the following connector.class

[source,java]
----
connector.class=org.apache.camel.kafkaconnector.smpp.CamelSmppSinkConnector
----


The camel-smpp sink connector supports 74 options, which are listed below.

| *camel.sink.path.host* | Hostname for the SMSC server to use. | "localhost" | MEDIUM
| *camel.sink.path.port* | Port number for the SMSC server to use. | "2775" | MEDIUM
| *camel.sink.endpoint.initialReconnectDelay* | Defines the initial delay in milliseconds after the consumer/producer tries to reconnect to the SMSC, after the connection was lost. | 5000L | MEDIUM
| *camel.sink.endpoint.maxReconnect* | Defines the maximum number of attempts to reconnect to the SMSC, if SMSC returns a negative bind response | 2147483647 | MEDIUM
| *camel.sink.endpoint.reconnectDelay* | Defines the interval in milliseconds between the reconnect attempts, if the connection to the SMSC was lost and the previous was not succeed. | 5000L | MEDIUM
| *camel.sink.endpoint.splittingPolicy* | You can specify a policy for handling long messages: ALLOW - the default, long messages are split to 140 bytes per message TRUNCATE - long messages are split and only the first fragment will be sent to the SMSC. Some carriers drop subsequent fragments so this reduces load on the SMPP connection sending parts of a message that will never be delivered. REJECT - if a message would need to be split, it is rejected with an SMPP NegativeResponseException and the reason code signifying the message is too long. One of: [ALLOW] [REJECT] [TRUNCATE] | "ALLOW" | MEDIUM
| *camel.sink.endpoint.systemType* | This parameter is used to categorize the type of ESME (External Short Message Entity) that is binding to the SMSC (max. 13 characters). | null | MEDIUM
| *camel.sink.endpoint.destAddr* | Defines the destination SME address. For mobile terminated messages, this is the directory number of the recipient MS. Only for SubmitSm, SubmitMulti, CancelSm and DataSm. | "1717" | MEDIUM
