= camel-rabbitmq-kafka-connector source configuration

When using camel-rabbitmq-kafka-connector as source make sure to use the following Maven dependency to have support for the connector:

[source,xml]
----
<dependency>
  <groupId>org.apache.camel.kafkaconnector</groupId>
  <artifactId>camel-rabbitmq-kafka-connector</artifactId>
  <version>x.x.x</version>
  <!-- use the same version as your Camel Kafka connector version -->
</dependency>
----

To use this Source connector in Kafka connect you'll need to set the following connector.class

[source,java]
----
connector.class=org.apache.camel.kafkaconnector.rabbitmq.CamelRabbitmqSourceConnector
----


The camel-rabbitmq source connector supports 98 options, which are listed below.

|===
| Name | Description | Default | Priority
| *camel.source.path.exchangeName* | The exchange name determines the exchange to which the produced messages will be sent to. In the case of consumers, the exchange name determines the exchange the queue will be bound to. | null | HIGH
| *camel.source.endpoint.addresses* | If this option is set, camel-rabbitmq will try to create connection based on the setting of option addresses. The addresses value is a string which looks like server1:12345, server2:12345 | null | MEDIUM
| *camel.source.endpoint.autoDelete* | If it is true, the exchange will be deleted when it is no longer in use | true | MEDIUM
| *camel.source.endpoint.automaticRecoveryEnabled* | Enables connection automatic recovery (uses connection implementation that performs automatic recovery when existing connection has failures) | "true" | MEDIUM
| *camel.source.endpoint.connectionFactory* | To use a custom RabbitMQ connection factory. When this option is set, all connection options (connectionTimeout, requestedChannelMax...) set on URI are not used | null | MEDIUM
| *camel.source.endpoint.deadLetterExchange* | The name of the dead letter exchange | null | MEDIUM

| *camel.source.endpoint.deadLetterRoutingKey* | The routing key for the dead letter exchange | null | MEDIUM
| *camel.source.endpoint.declare* | If the option is true, camel declare the exchange and queue name and bind them together. If the option is false, camel won't declare the exchange and queue name on the server. | true | MEDIUM
| *camel.source.endpoint.durable* | If we are declaring a durable exchange (the exchange will survive a server restart) | true | MEDIUM
| *camel.source.endpoint.exchangeType* | The exchange type such as direct or topic. One of: [direct] [fanout] [headers] [topic] | "direct" | MEDIUM
| *camel.source.endpoint.exclusive* | Exclusive queues may only be accessed by the current connection, and are deleted when that connection closes. | false | MEDIUM
