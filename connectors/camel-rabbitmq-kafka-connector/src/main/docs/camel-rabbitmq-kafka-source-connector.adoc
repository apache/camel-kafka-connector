When using camel-rabbitmq-kafka-connector as source make sure to use the following Maven dependency to have support for the connector:

[source,xml]

|===
| Name | Description | Default | Priority
| *camel.source.path.exchangeName* | The exchange name determines the exchange to which the produced messages will be sent to. In the case of consumers, the exchange name determines the exchange the queue will be bound to. | null | HIGH
| *camel.source.endpoint.addresses* | If this option is set, camel-rabbitmq will try to create connection based on the setting of option addresses. The addresses value is a string which looks like server1:12345, server2:12345 | null | MEDIUM
| *camel.source.endpoint.autoDelete* | If it is true, the exchange will be deleted when it is no longer in use | true | MEDIUM
| *camel.source.endpoint.automaticRecoveryEnabled* | Enables connection automatic recovery (uses connection implementation that performs automatic recovery when existing connection has failures) | "true" | MEDIUM
| *camel.source.endpoint.connectionFactory* | To use a custom RabbitMQ connection factory. When this option is set, all connection options (connectionTimeout, requestedChannelMax...) set on URI are not used | null | MEDIUM

| *camel.source.endpoint.skipQueueBind* | If true the queue will not be bound to the exchange after declaring it | false | MEDIUM
