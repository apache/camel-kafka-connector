= camel-mllp-kafka-connector sink configuration

When using camel-mllp-kafka-connector as sink make sure to use the following Maven dependency to have support for the connector:

[source,xml]
----
<dependency>
  <groupId>org.apache.camel.kafkaconnector</groupId>
  <artifactId>camel-mllp-kafka-connector</artifactId>
  <version>x.x.x</version>
  <!-- use the same version as your Camel Kafka connector version -->
</dependency>
----

To use this Sink connector in Kafka connect you'll need to set the following connector.class

[source,java]
----
connector.class=org.apache.camel.kafkaconnector.mllp.CamelMllpSinkConnector
----


The camel-mllp sink connector supports 25 options, which are listed below.



[width="100%",cols="2,5,^1,2",options="header"]
|===
| Name | Description | Default | Priority
| *camel.sink.path.hostname* | Hostname or IP for connection for the TCP connection. The default value is null, which means any local IP address | null | HIGH
| *camel.sink.path.port* | Port number for the TCP connection | null | HIGH
| *camel.sink.endpoint.autoAck* | Enable/Disable the automatic generation of a MLLP Acknowledgement MLLP Consumers only | true | MEDIUM
| *camel.sink.endpoint.bufferWrites* | Enable/Disable the buffering of HL7 payloads before writing to the socket. | false | LOW
| *camel.sink.endpoint.hl7Headers* | Enable/Disable the automatic generation of message headers from the HL7 Message MLLP Consumers only | true | MEDIUM
| *camel.sink.endpoint.requireEndOfData* | Enable/Disable strict compliance to the MLLP standard. The MLLP standard specifies START_OF_BLOCKhl7 payloadEND_OF_BLOCKEND_OF_DATA, however, some systems do not send the final END_OF_DATA byte. This setting controls whether or not the final END_OF_DATA byte is required or optional. | true | MEDIUM
| *camel.sink.endpoint.stringPayload* | Enable/Disable converting the payload to a String. If enabled, HL7 Payloads received from external systems will be validated converted to a String. If the charsetName property is set, that character set will be used for the conversion. If the charsetName property is not set, the value of MSH-18 will be used to determine th appropriate character set. If MSH-18 is not set, then the default ISO-8859-1 character set will be use. | true | MEDIUM
| *camel.sink.endpoint.validatePayload* | Enable/Disable the validation of HL7 Payloads If enabled, HL7 Payloads received from external systems will be validated (see Hl7Util.generateInvalidPayloadExceptionMessage for details on the validation). If and invalid payload is detected, a MllpInvalidMessageException (for consumers) or a MllpInvalidAcknowledgementException will be thrown. | false | MEDIUM
| *camel.sink.endpoint.lazyStartProducer* | Whether the producer should be started lazy (on the first message). By starting lazy you can use this to allow CamelContext and routes to startup in situations where a producer may otherwise fail during starting and cause the route to fail being started. By deferring this startup to be lazy then the startup failure can be handled during routing messages via Camel's routing error handlers. Beware that when the first message is processed then creating and starting the producer may take a little time and prolong the total processing time of the processing. | false | MEDIUM
| *camel.sink.endpoint.basicPropertyBinding* | Whether the endpoint should use basic property binding (Camel 2.x) or the newer property binding with additional capabilities | false | MEDIUM
| *camel.sink.endpoint.synchronous* | Sets whether synchronous processing should be strictly used (this component only supports synchronous operations). | true | MEDIUM
| *camel.sink.endpoint.charsetName* | Set the CamelCharsetName property on the exchange | null | MEDIUM
| *camel.sink.endpoint.keepAlive* | Enable/disable the SO_KEEPALIVE socket option. | "true" | MEDIUM
| *camel.sink.endpoint.receiveBufferSize* | Sets the SO_RCVBUF option to the specified value (in bytes) | "8192" | MEDIUM
| *camel.sink.endpoint.sendBufferSize* | Sets the SO_SNDBUF option to the specified value (in bytes) | "8192" | MEDIUM
| *camel.sink.endpoint.tcpNoDelay* | Enable/disable the TCP_NODELAY socket option. | "true" | MEDIUM
| *camel.sink.endpoint.connectTimeout* | Timeout (in milliseconds) for establishing for a TCP connection TCP Client only | 30000 | MEDIUM
| *camel.sink.endpoint.idleTimeout* | The approximate idle time allowed before the Client TCP Connection will be reset. A null value or a value less than or equal to zero will disable the idle timeout. | null | MEDIUM
| *camel.sink.endpoint.readTimeout* | The SO_TIMEOUT value (in milliseconds) used after the start of an MLLP frame has been received | 5000 | MEDIUM
| *camel.sink.endpoint.receiveTimeout* | The SO_TIMEOUT value (in milliseconds) used when waiting for the start of an MLLP frame | 15000 | MEDIUM
| *camel.component.mllp.lazyStartProducer* | Whether the producer should be started lazy (on the first message). By starting lazy you can use this to allow CamelContext and routes to startup in situations where a producer may otherwise fail during starting and cause the route to fail being started. By deferring this startup to be lazy then the startup failure can be handled during routing messages via Camel's routing error handlers. Beware that when the first message is processed then creating and starting the producer may take a little time and prolong the total processing time of the processing. | false | MEDIUM
| *camel.component.mllp.basicPropertyBinding* | Whether the component should use basic property binding (Camel 2.x) or the newer property binding with additional capabilities | false | LOW
| *camel.component.mllp.defaultCharset* | Set the default character set to use for byte to/from String conversions. | "ISO-8859-1" | MEDIUM
| *camel.component.mllp.logPhi* | Set the component to log PHI data. | "true" | MEDIUM
| *camel.component.mllp.logPhiMaxBytes* | Set the maximum number of bytes of PHI that will be logged in a log entry. | "5120" | MEDIUM
