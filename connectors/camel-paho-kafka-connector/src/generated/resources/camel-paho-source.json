The following properties can be used: com.ibm.ssl.protocol One of: SSL, SSLv3, TLS, TLSv1, SSL_TLS. com.ibm.ssl.contextProvider Underlying JSSE provider. For example IBMJSSE2 or SunJSSE com.ibm.ssl.keyStore The name of the file that contains the KeyStore object that you want the KeyManager to use. For example \/mydir\/etc\/key.p12 com.ibm.ssl.keyStorePassword The password for the KeyStore object that you want the KeyManager to use. The password can either be in plain-text, or may be obfuscated using the static method: com.ibm.micro.security.Password.obfuscate(char password). This obfuscates the password using a simple and insecure XOR and Base64 encoding mechanism. Note that this is only a simple scrambler to obfuscate clear-text passwords. com.ibm.ssl.keyStoreType Type of key store, for example PKCS12, JKS, or JCEKS. com.ibm.ssl.keyStoreProvider Key store provider, for example IBMJCE or IBMJCEFIPS. com.ibm.ssl.trustStore The name of the file that contains the KeyStore object that you want the TrustManager to use. com.ibm.ssl.trustStorePassword The password for the TrustStore object that you want the TrustManager to use. The password can either be in plain-text, or may be obfuscated using the static method: com.ibm.micro.security.Password.obfuscate(char password). This obfuscates the password using a simple and insecure XOR and Base64 encoding mechanism. Note that this is only a simple scrambler to obfuscate clear-text passwords. com.ibm.ssl.trustStoreType The type of KeyStore object that you want the default TrustManager to use. Same possible values as keyStoreType. com.ibm.ssl.trustStoreProvider Trust store provider, for example IBMJCE or IBMJCEFIPS. com.ibm.ssl.enabledCipherSuites A list of which ciphers are enabled. Values are dependent on the provider, for example: SSL_RSA_WITH_AES_128_CBC_SHA;SSL_RSA_WITH_3DES_EDE_CBC_SHA. com.ibm.ssl.keyManager Sets the algorithm that will be used to instantiate a KeyManagerFactory object instead of using the default algorithm available in the platform. Example values: IbmX509 or IBMJ9X509. com.ibm.ssl.trustManager Sets the algorithm that will be used to instantiate a TrustManagerFactory object instead of using the default algorithm available in the platform. Example values: PKIX or IBMJ9X509.",
