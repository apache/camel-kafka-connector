The camel-sjms2 sink connector supports 43 options, which are listed below.



[width="100%",cols="2,5,^1,1,1",options="header"]
|===
| Name | Description | Default | Required | Priority
| *camel.sink.path.destinationType* | The kind of destination to use One of: [queue] [topic] | "queue" | false | MEDIUM
| *camel.sink.path.destinationName* | DestinationName is a JMS queue or topic name. By default, the destinationName is interpreted as a queue name. | null | true | HIGH
| *camel.sink.endpoint.acknowledgementMode* | The JMS acknowledgement name, which is one of: SESSION_TRANSACTED, CLIENT_ACKNOWLEDGE, AUTO_ACKNOWLEDGE, DUPS_OK_ACKNOWLEDGE One of: [SESSION_TRANSACTED] [CLIENT_ACKNOWLEDGE] [AUTO_ACKNOWLEDGE] [DUPS_OK_ACKNOWLEDGE] | "AUTO_ACKNOWLEDGE" | false | MEDIUM
| *camel.sink.endpoint.connectionFactory* | The connection factory to be use. A connection factory must be configured either on the component or endpoint. | null | false | MEDIUM
| *camel.sink.endpoint.disableReplyTo* | Specifies whether Camel ignores the JMSReplyTo header in messages. If true, Camel does not send a reply back to the destination specified in the JMSReplyTo header. You can use this option if you want Camel to consume from a route and you do not want Camel to automatically send back a reply message because another component in your code handles the reply message. You can also use this option if you want to use Camel as a proxy between different message brokers and you want to route message from one system to another. | false | false | MEDIUM
| *camel.sink.endpoint.replyTo* | Provides an explicit ReplyTo destination (overrides any incoming value of Message.getJMSReplyTo() in consumer). | null | false | MEDIUM
| *camel.sink.endpoint.testConnectionOnStartup* | Specifies whether to test the connection on startup. This ensures that when Camel starts that all the JMS consumers have a valid connection to the JMS broker. If a connection cannot be granted then Camel throws an exception on startup. This ensures that Camel is not started with failed connections. The JMS producers is tested as well. | false | false | MEDIUM
| *camel.sink.endpoint.deliveryMode* | Specifies the delivery mode to be used. Possible values are those defined by javax.jms.DeliveryMode. NON_PERSISTENT = 1 and PERSISTENT = 2. One of: [1] [2] | null | false | MEDIUM
| *camel.sink.endpoint.deliveryPersistent* | Specifies whether persistent delivery is used by default. | true | false | MEDIUM
| *camel.sink.endpoint.lazyStartProducer* | Whether the producer should be started lazy (on the first message). By starting lazy you can use this to allow CamelContext and routes to startup in situations where a producer may otherwise fail during starting and cause the route to fail being started. By deferring this startup to be lazy then the startup failure can be handled during routing messages via Camel's routing error handlers. Beware that when the first message is processed then creating and starting the producer may take a little time and prolong the total processing time of the processing. | false | false | MEDIUM
| *camel.sink.endpoint.priority* | Values greater than 1 specify the message priority when sending (where 1 is the lowest priority and 9 is the highest). The explicitQosEnabled option must also be enabled in order for this option to have any effect. One of: [1] [2] [3] [4] [5] [6] [7] [8] [9] | 4 | false | MEDIUM
| *camel.sink.endpoint.replyToConcurrentConsumers* | Specifies the default number of concurrent consumers when doing request/reply over JMS. See also the maxMessagesPerTask option to control dynamic scaling up/down of threads. | 1 | false | MEDIUM
| *camel.sink.endpoint.replyToOverride* | Provides an explicit ReplyTo destination in the JMS message, which overrides the setting of replyTo. It is useful if you want to forward the message to a remote Queue and receive the reply message from the ReplyTo destination. | null | false | MEDIUM
| *camel.sink.endpoint.replyToType* | Allows for explicitly specifying which kind of strategy to use for replyTo queues when doing request/reply over JMS. Possible values are: Temporary or Exclusive. By default Camel will use temporary queues. However if replyTo has been configured, then Exclusive is used. One of: [Temporary] [Exclusive] | null | false | MEDIUM
| *camel.sink.endpoint.requestTimeout* | The timeout for waiting for a reply when using the InOut Exchange Pattern (in milliseconds). The default is 20 seconds. You can include the header CamelJmsRequestTimeout to override this endpoint configured timeout value, and thus have per message individual timeout values. See also the requestTimeoutCheckerInterval option. | 20000L | false | MEDIUM
| *camel.sink.endpoint.timeToLive* | When sending messages, specifies the time-to-live of the message (in milliseconds). | -1L | false | MEDIUM
| *camel.sink.endpoint.allowNullBody* | Whether to allow sending messages with no body. If this option is false and the message body is null, then an JMSException is thrown. | true | false | MEDIUM
| *camel.sink.endpoint.disableTimeToLive* | Use this option to force disabling time to live. For example when you do request/reply over JMS, then Camel will by default use the requestTimeout value as time to live on the message being sent. The problem is that the sender and receiver systems have to have their clocks synchronized, so they are in sync. This is not always so easy to archive. So you can use disableTimeToLive=true to not set a time to live value on the sent message. Then the message will not expire on the receiver system. See below in section About time to live for more details. | false | false | MEDIUM
| *camel.sink.endpoint.explicitQosEnabled* | Set if the deliveryMode, priority or timeToLive qualities of service should be used when sending messages. This option is based on Spring's JmsTemplate. The deliveryMode, priority and timeToLive options are applied to the current endpoint. This contrasts with the preserveMessageQos option, which operates at message granularity, reading QoS properties exclusively from the Camel In message headers. | "false" | false | MEDIUM
| *camel.sink.endpoint.preserveMessageQos* | Set to true, if you want to send message using the QoS settings specified on the message, instead of the QoS settings on the JMS endpoint. The following three headers are considered JMSPriority, JMSDeliveryMode, and JMSExpiration. You can provide all or only some of them. If not provided, Camel will fall back to use the values from the endpoint instead. So, when using this option, the headers override the values from the endpoint. The explicitQosEnabled option, by contrast, will only use options set on the endpoint, and not values from the message header. | false | false | MEDIUM
| *camel.sink.endpoint.asyncStartListener* | Whether to startup the consumer message listener asynchronously, when starting a route. For example if a JmsConsumer cannot get a connection to a remote JMS broker, then it may block while retrying and/or failover. This will cause Camel to block while starting routes. By setting this option to true, you will let routes startup, while the JmsConsumer connects to the JMS broker using a dedicated thread in asynchronous mode. If this option is used, then beware that if the connection could not be established, then an exception is logged at WARN level, and the consumer will not be able to receive messages; You can then restart the route to retry. | false | false | MEDIUM
| *camel.sink.endpoint.asyncStopListener* | Whether to stop the consumer message listener asynchronously, when stopping a route. | false | false | MEDIUM
| *camel.sink.endpoint.destinationCreationStrategy* | To use a custom DestinationCreationStrategy. | null | false | MEDIUM
| *camel.sink.endpoint.exceptionListener* | Specifies the JMS Exception Listener that is to be notified of any underlying JMS exceptions. | null | false | MEDIUM
| *camel.sink.endpoint.headerFilterStrategy* | To use a custom HeaderFilterStrategy to filter header to and from Camel message. | null | false | MEDIUM
| *camel.sink.endpoint.includeAllJMSXProperties* | Whether to include all JMSXxxx properties when mapping from JMS to Camel Message. Setting this to true will include properties such as JMSXAppID, and JMSXUserID etc. Note: If you are using a custom headerFilterStrategy then this option does not apply. | false | false | MEDIUM
| *camel.sink.endpoint.jmsKeyFormatStrategy* | Pluggable strategy for encoding and decoding JMS keys so they can be compliant with the JMS specification. Camel provides two implementations out of the box: default and passthrough. The default strategy will safely marshal dots and hyphens (. and -). The passthrough strategy leaves the key as is. Can be used for JMS brokers which do not care whether JMS header keys contain illegal characters. You can provide your own implementation of the org.apache.camel.component.jms.JmsKeyFormatStrategy and refer to it using the # notation. | null | false | MEDIUM
| *camel.sink.endpoint.mapJmsMessage* | Specifies whether Camel should auto map the received JMS message to a suited payload type, such as javax.jms.TextMessage to a String etc. See section about how mapping works below for more details. | true | false | MEDIUM
| *camel.sink.endpoint.messageCreatedStrategy* | To use the given MessageCreatedStrategy which are invoked when Camel creates new instances of javax.jms.Message objects when Camel is sending a JMS message. | null | false | MEDIUM
| *camel.sink.endpoint.recoveryInterval* | Specifies the interval between recovery attempts, i.e. when a connection is being refreshed, in milliseconds. The default is 5000 ms, that is, 5 seconds. | 5000L | false | MEDIUM
| *camel.sink.endpoint.synchronous* | Sets whether synchronous processing should be strictly used, or Camel is allowed to use asynchronous processing (if supported). | false | false | MEDIUM
| *camel.sink.endpoint.transferException* | If enabled and you are using Request Reply messaging (InOut) and an Exchange failed on the consumer side, then the caused Exception will be send back in response as a javax.jms.ObjectMessage. If the client is Camel, the returned Exception is rethrown. This allows you to use Camel JMS as a bridge in your routing - for example, using persistent queues to enable robust routing. Notice that if you also have transferExchange enabled, this option takes precedence. The caught exception is required to be serializable. The original Exception on the consumer side can be wrapped in an outer exception such as org.apache.camel.RuntimeCamelException when returned to the producer. Use this with caution as the data is using Java Object serialization and requires the received to be able to deserialize the data at Class level, which forces a strong coupling between the producers and consumer! | false | false | MEDIUM
| *camel.sink.endpoint.transacted* | Specifies whether to use transacted mode | false | false | MEDIUM
| *camel.component.sjms2.connectionFactory* | The connection factory to be use. A connection factory must be configured either on the component or endpoint. | null | false | MEDIUM
| *camel.component.sjms2.lazyStartProducer* | Whether the producer should be started lazy (on the first message). By starting lazy you can use this to allow CamelContext and routes to startup in situations where a producer may otherwise fail during starting and cause the route to fail being started. By deferring this startup to be lazy then the startup failure can be handled during routing messages via Camel's routing error handlers. Beware that when the first message is processed then creating and starting the producer may take a little time and prolong the total processing time of the processing. | false | false | MEDIUM
| *camel.component.sjms2.autowiredEnabled* | Whether autowiring is enabled. This is used for automatic autowiring options (the option must be marked as autowired) by looking up in the registry to find if there is a single instance of matching type, which then gets configured on the component. This can be used for automatic configuring JDBC data sources, JMS connection factories, AWS Clients, etc. | true | false | MEDIUM
| *camel.component.sjms2.destinationCreationStrategy* | To use a custom DestinationCreationStrategy. | null | false | MEDIUM
| *camel.component.sjms2.jmsKeyFormatStrategy* | Pluggable strategy for encoding and decoding JMS keys so they can be compliant with the JMS specification. Camel provides one implementation out of the box: default. The default strategy will safely marshal dots and hyphens (. and -). Can be used for JMS brokers which do not care whether JMS header keys contain illegal characters. You can provide your own implementation of the org.apache.camel.component.jms.JmsKeyFormatStrategy and refer to it using the # notation. | null | false | MEDIUM
| *camel.component.sjms2.messageCreatedStrategy* | To use the given MessageCreatedStrategy which are invoked when Camel creates new instances of javax.jms.Message objects when Camel is sending a JMS message. | null | false | MEDIUM
| *camel.component.sjms2.recoveryInterval* | Specifies the interval between recovery attempts, i.e. when a connection is being refreshed, in milliseconds. The default is 5000 ms, that is, 5 seconds. | 5000L | false | MEDIUM
| *camel.component.sjms2.replyToOnTimeoutMax ConcurrentConsumers* | Specifies the maximum number of concurrent consumers for continue routing when timeout occurred when using request/reply over JMS. | 1 | false | MEDIUM
| *camel.component.sjms2.requestTimeoutChecker Interval* | Configures how often Camel should check for timed out Exchanges when doing request/reply over JMS. By default Camel checks once per second. But if you must react faster when a timeout occurs, then you can lower this interval, to check more frequently. The timeout is determined by the option requestTimeout. | 1000L | false | MEDIUM
| *camel.component.sjms2.headerFilterStrategy* | To use a custom org.apache.camel.spi.HeaderFilterStrategy to filter header to and from Camel message. | null | false | MEDIUM

[NOTE]
====
Do not use activemq-all 5.16.0 or older with the SJMS2 connector. 
The activemq-all jar contains packages older versions of Camel that cause conflict when trying to run the SJMS2 connector. You may find very interesting errors such as java.lang.NoSuchMethodError: org.apache.camel.main.Main.configure()Lorg/apache/camel/main/MainConfigurationProperties when trying to do so.
