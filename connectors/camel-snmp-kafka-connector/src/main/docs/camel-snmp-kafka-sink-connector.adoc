= camel-snmp-kafka-connector sink configuration

When using camel-snmp-kafka-connector as sink make sure to use the following Maven dependency to have support for the connector:

[source,xml]
----
<dependency>
  <groupId>org.apache.camel.kafkaconnector</groupId>
  <artifactId>camel-snmp-kafka-connector</artifactId>
  <version>x.x.x</version>
  <!-- use the same version as your Camel Kafka connector version -->
</dependency>
----

To use this Sink connector in Kafka connect you'll need to set the following connector.class

[source,java]
----
connector.class=org.apache.camel.kafkaconnector.snmp.CamelSnmpSinkConnector
----


The camel-snmp sink connector supports 22 options, which are listed below.



[width="100%",cols="2,5,^1,2",options="header"]
|===
| Name | Description | Default | Priority
| *camel.sink.path.host* | Hostname of the SNMP enabled device | null | HIGH
| *camel.sink.path.port* | Port number of the SNMP enabled device | null | HIGH
| *camel.sink.endpoint.oids* | Defines which values you are interested in. Please have a look at the Wikipedia to get a better understanding. You may provide a single OID or a coma separated list of OIDs. Example: oids=1.3.6.1.2.1.1.3.0,1.3.6.1.2.1.25.3.2.1.5.1,1.3.6.1.2.1.25.3.5.1.1.1,1.3.6.1.2.1.43.5.1.1.11.1 | null | MEDIUM
| *camel.sink.endpoint.protocol* | Here you can select which protocol to use. You can use either udp or tcp. One of: [tcp] [udp] | "udp" | MEDIUM
| *camel.sink.endpoint.retries* | Defines how often a retry is made before canceling the request. | 2 | MEDIUM
| *camel.sink.endpoint.snmpCommunity* | Sets the community octet string for the snmp request. | "public" | MEDIUM
| *camel.sink.endpoint.snmpContextEngineId* | Sets the context engine ID field of the scoped PDU. | null | MEDIUM
| *camel.sink.endpoint.snmpContextName* | Sets the context name field of this scoped PDU. | null | MEDIUM
| *camel.sink.endpoint.snmpVersion* | Sets the snmp version for the request. The value 0 means SNMPv1, 1 means SNMPv2c, and the value 3 means SNMPv3 One of: [0] [1] [3] | 0 | MEDIUM
| *camel.sink.endpoint.timeout* | Sets the timeout value for the request in millis. | 1500 | MEDIUM
| *camel.sink.endpoint.type* | Which operation to perform such as poll, trap, etc. One of: [TRAP] [POLL] [GET_NEXT] | null | MEDIUM
| *camel.sink.endpoint.lazyStartProducer* | Whether the producer should be started lazy (on the first message). By starting lazy you can use this to allow CamelContext and routes to startup in situations where a producer may otherwise fail during starting and cause the route to fail being started. By deferring this startup to be lazy then the startup failure can be handled during routing messages via Camel's routing error handlers. Beware that when the first message is processed then creating and starting the producer may take a little time and prolong the total processing time of the processing. | false | MEDIUM
| *camel.sink.endpoint.basicPropertyBinding* | Whether the endpoint should use basic property binding (Camel 2.x) or the newer property binding with additional capabilities | false | MEDIUM
| *camel.sink.endpoint.synchronous* | Sets whether synchronous processing should be strictly used, or Camel is allowed to use asynchronous processing (if supported). | false | MEDIUM
| *camel.sink.endpoint.authenticationPassphrase* | The authentication passphrase. If not null, authenticationProtocol must also be not null. RFC3414 11.2 requires passphrases to have a minimum length of 8 bytes. If the length of authenticationPassphrase is less than 8 bytes an IllegalArgumentException is thrown. | null | MEDIUM
| *camel.sink.endpoint.authenticationProtocol* | Authentication protocol to use if security level is set to enable authentication The possible values are: MD5, SHA1 One of: [MD5] [SHA1] | null | MEDIUM
| *camel.sink.endpoint.privacyPassphrase* | The privacy passphrase. If not null, privacyProtocol must also be not null. RFC3414 11.2 requires passphrases to have a minimum length of 8 bytes. If the length of authenticationPassphrase is less than 8 bytes an IllegalArgumentException is thrown. | null | MEDIUM
| *camel.sink.endpoint.privacyProtocol* | The privacy protocol ID to be associated with this user. If set to null, this user only supports unencrypted messages. | null | MEDIUM
| *camel.sink.endpoint.securityLevel* | Sets the security level for this target. The supplied security level must be supported by the security model dependent information associated with the security name set for this target. The value 1 means: No authentication and no encryption. Anyone can create and read messages with this security level The value 2 means: Authentication and no encryption. Only the one with the right authentication key can create messages with this security level, but anyone can read the contents of the message. The value 3 means: Authentication and encryption. Only the one with the right authentication key can create messages with this security level, and only the one with the right encryption/decryption key can read the contents of the message. One of: [1] [2] [3] | 3 | MEDIUM
| *camel.sink.endpoint.securityName* | Sets the security name to be used with this target. | null | MEDIUM
| *camel.component.snmp.lazyStartProducer* | Whether the producer should be started lazy (on the first message). By starting lazy you can use this to allow CamelContext and routes to startup in situations where a producer may otherwise fail during starting and cause the route to fail being started. By deferring this startup to be lazy then the startup failure can be handled during routing messages via Camel's routing error handlers. Beware that when the first message is processed then creating and starting the producer may take a little time and prolong the total processing time of the processing. | false | MEDIUM
| *camel.component.snmp.basicPropertyBinding* | Whether the component should use basic property binding (Camel 2.x) or the newer property binding with additional capabilities | false | LOW
