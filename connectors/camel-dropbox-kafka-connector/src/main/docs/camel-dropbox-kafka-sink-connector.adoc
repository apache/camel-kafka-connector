[width="100%",cols="2,5,^1,2",options="header"]
|===
| Name | Description | Default | Priority
| *camel.sink.path.operation* | The specific action (typically is a CRUD action) to perform on Dropbox remote folder. One of: [put] [del] [search] [get] [move] | null | HIGH
| *camel.sink.endpoint.accessToken* | The access token to make API requests for a specific Dropbox user | null | HIGH
| *camel.sink.endpoint.client* | To use an existing DbxClient instance as DropBox client. | null | MEDIUM
| *camel.sink.endpoint.clientIdentifier* | Name of the app registered to make API requests | null | MEDIUM
| *camel.sink.endpoint.localPath* | Optional folder or file to upload on Dropbox from the local filesystem. If this option has not been configured then the message body is used as the content to upload. | null | MEDIUM
| *camel.sink.endpoint.newRemotePath* | Destination file or folder | null | MEDIUM
| *camel.sink.endpoint.query* | A space-separated list of sub-strings to search for. A file matches only if it contains all the sub-strings. If this option is not set, all files will be matched. | null | MEDIUM
| *camel.sink.endpoint.remotePath* | Original file or folder to move | null | MEDIUM
| *camel.sink.endpoint.uploadMode* | Which mode to upload. in case of add the new file will be renamed if a file with the same name already exists on dropbox. in case of force if a file with the same name already exists on dropbox, this will be overwritten. One of: [add] [force] | null | MEDIUM
| *camel.sink.endpoint.lazyStartProducer* | Whether the producer should be started lazy (on the first message). By starting lazy you can use this to allow CamelContext and routes to startup in situations where a producer may otherwise fail during starting and cause the route to fail being started. By deferring this startup to be lazy then the startup failure can be handled during routing messages via Camel's routing error handlers. Beware that when the first message is processed then creating and starting the producer may take a little time and prolong the total processing time of the processing. | false | MEDIUM
| *camel.sink.endpoint.basicPropertyBinding* | Whether the endpoint should use basic property binding (Camel 2.x) or the newer property binding with additional capabilities | false | MEDIUM
| *camel.sink.endpoint.synchronous* | Sets whether synchronous processing should be strictly used, or Camel is allowed to use asynchronous processing (if supported). | false | MEDIUM
| *camel.component.dropbox.lazyStartProducer* | Whether the producer should be started lazy (on the first message). By starting lazy you can use this to allow CamelContext and routes to startup in situations where a producer may otherwise fail during starting and cause the route to fail being started. By deferring this startup to be lazy then the startup failure can be handled during routing messages via Camel's routing error handlers. Beware that when the first message is processed then creating and starting the producer may take a little time and prolong the total processing time of the processing. | false | MEDIUM
| *camel.component.dropbox.basicPropertyBinding* | Whether the component should use basic property binding (Camel 2.x) or the newer property binding with additional capabilities | false | LOW
