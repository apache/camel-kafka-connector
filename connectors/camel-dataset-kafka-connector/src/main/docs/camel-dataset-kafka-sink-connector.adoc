= camel-dataset-kafka-connector sink configuration

When using camel-dataset-kafka-connector as sink make sure to use the following Maven dependency to have support for the connector:

[source,xml]
----
<dependency>
  <groupId>org.apache.camel.kafkaconnector</groupId>
  <artifactId>camel-dataset-kafka-connector</artifactId>
  <version>x.x.x</version>
  <!-- use the same version as your Camel Kafka connector version -->
</dependency>
----

To use this Sink connector in Kafka connect you'll need to set the following connector.class

[source,java]
----
connector.class=org.apache.camel.kafkaconnector.dataset.CamelDatasetSinkConnector
----


The camel-dataset sink connector supports 18 options, which are listed below.



[width="100%",cols="2,5,^1,2",options="header"]
|===
| Name | Description | Default | Priority
| *camel.sink.path.name* | Name of DataSet to lookup in the registry | null | HIGH
| *camel.sink.endpoint.dataSetIndex* | Controls the behaviour of the CamelDataSetIndex header. For Consumers: - off = the header will not be set - strict/lenient = the header will be set For Producers: - off = the header value will not be verified, and will not be set if it is not present = strict = the header value must be present and will be verified = lenient = the header value will be verified if it is present, and will be set if it is not present One of: [strict] [lenient] [off] | "lenient" | MEDIUM
| *camel.sink.endpoint.assertPeriod* | Sets a grace period after which the mock endpoint will re-assert to ensure the preliminary assertion is still valid. This is used for example to assert that exactly a number of messages arrives. For example if expectedMessageCount(int) was set to 5, then the assertion is satisfied when 5 or more message arrives. To ensure that exactly 5 messages arrives, then you would need to wait a little period to ensure no further message arrives. This is what you can use this method for. By default this period is disabled. | 0L | MEDIUM
| *camel.sink.endpoint.consumeDelay* | Allows a delay to be specified which causes a delay when a message is consumed by the producer (to simulate slow processing) | 0L | MEDIUM
| *camel.sink.endpoint.expectedCount* | Specifies the expected number of message exchanges that should be received by this endpoint. Beware: If you want to expect that 0 messages, then take extra care, as 0 matches when the tests starts, so you need to set a assert period time to let the test run for a while to make sure there are still no messages arrived; for that use setAssertPeriod(long). An alternative is to use NotifyBuilder, and use the notifier to know when Camel is done routing some messages, before you call the assertIsSatisfied() method on the mocks. This allows you to not use a fixed assert period, to speedup testing times. If you want to assert that exactly n'th message arrives to this mock endpoint, then see also the setAssertPeriod(long) method for further details. | -1 | MEDIUM
| *camel.sink.endpoint.failFast* | Sets whether assertIsSatisfied() should fail fast at the first detected failed expectation while it may otherwise wait for all expected messages to arrive before performing expectations verifications. Is by default true. Set to false to use behavior as in Camel 2.x. | false | MEDIUM
| *camel.sink.endpoint.lazyStartProducer* | Whether the producer should be started lazy (on the first message). By starting lazy you can use this to allow CamelContext and routes to startup in situations where a producer may otherwise fail during starting and cause the route to fail being started. By deferring this startup to be lazy then the startup failure can be handled during routing messages via Camel's routing error handlers. Beware that when the first message is processed then creating and starting the producer may take a little time and prolong the total processing time of the processing. | false | MEDIUM
| *camel.sink.endpoint.reportGroup* | A number that is used to turn on throughput logging based on groups of the size. | null | MEDIUM
| *camel.sink.endpoint.resultMinimumWaitTime* | Sets the minimum expected amount of time (in millis) the assertIsSatisfied() will wait on a latch until it is satisfied | 0L | MEDIUM
| *camel.sink.endpoint.resultWaitTime* | Sets the maximum amount of time (in millis) the assertIsSatisfied() will wait on a latch until it is satisfied | 0L | MEDIUM
| *camel.sink.endpoint.retainFirst* | Specifies to only retain the first n'th number of received Exchanges. This is used when testing with big data, to reduce memory consumption by not storing copies of every Exchange this mock endpoint receives. Important: When using this limitation, then the getReceivedCounter() will still return the actual number of received Exchanges. For example if we have received 5000 Exchanges, and have configured to only retain the first 10 Exchanges, then the getReceivedCounter() will still return 5000 but there is only the first 10 Exchanges in the getExchanges() and getReceivedExchanges() methods. When using this method, then some of the other expectation methods is not supported, for example the expectedBodiesReceived(Object...) sets a expectation on the first number of bodies received. You can configure both setRetainFirst(int) and setRetainLast(int) methods, to limit both the first and last received. | -1 | MEDIUM
| *camel.sink.endpoint.retainLast* | Specifies to only retain the last n'th number of received Exchanges. This is used when testing with big data, to reduce memory consumption by not storing copies of every Exchange this mock endpoint receives. Important: When using this limitation, then the getReceivedCounter() will still return the actual number of received Exchanges. For example if we have received 5000 Exchanges, and have configured to only retain the last 20 Exchanges, then the getReceivedCounter() will still return 5000 but there is only the last 20 Exchanges in the getExchanges() and getReceivedExchanges() methods. When using this method, then some of the other expectation methods is not supported, for example the expectedBodiesReceived(Object...) sets a expectation on the first number of bodies received. You can configure both setRetainFirst(int) and setRetainLast(int) methods, to limit both the first and last received. | -1 | MEDIUM
| *camel.sink.endpoint.sleepForEmptyTest* | Allows a sleep to be specified to wait to check that this endpoint really is empty when expectedMessageCount(int) is called with zero | 0L | MEDIUM
| *camel.sink.endpoint.copyOnExchange* | Sets whether to make a deep copy of the incoming Exchange when received at this mock endpoint. Is by default true. | true | MEDIUM
| *camel.sink.endpoint.basicPropertyBinding* | Whether the endpoint should use basic property binding (Camel 2.x) or the newer property binding with additional capabilities | false | MEDIUM
| *camel.sink.endpoint.synchronous* | Sets whether synchronous processing should be strictly used, or Camel is allowed to use asynchronous processing (if supported). | false | MEDIUM
| *camel.component.dataset.lazyStartProducer* | Whether the producer should be started lazy (on the first message). By starting lazy you can use this to allow CamelContext and routes to startup in situations where a producer may otherwise fail during starting and cause the route to fail being started. By deferring this startup to be lazy then the startup failure can be handled during routing messages via Camel's routing error handlers. Beware that when the first message is processed then creating and starting the producer may take a little time and prolong the total processing time of the processing. | false | MEDIUM
| *camel.component.dataset.basicPropertyBinding* | Whether the component should use basic property binding (Camel 2.x) or the newer property binding with additional capabilities | false | MEDIUM
