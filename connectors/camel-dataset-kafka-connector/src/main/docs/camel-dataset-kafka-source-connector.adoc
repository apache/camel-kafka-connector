= camel-dataset-kafka-connector source configuration

When using camel-dataset-kafka-connector as source make sure to use the following Maven dependency to have support for the connector:

[source,xml]
----
<dependency>
  <groupId>org.apache.camel.kafkaconnector</groupId>
  <artifactId>camel-dataset-kafka-connector</artifactId>
  <version>x.x.x</version>
  <!-- use the same version as your Camel Kafka connector version -->
</dependency>
----

To use this Source connector in Kafka connect you'll need to set the following connector.class

[source,java]
----
connector.class=org.apache.camel.kafkaconnector.dataset.CamelDatasetSourceConnector
----


The camel-dataset source connector supports 13 options, which are listed below.



[width="100%",cols="2,5,^1,2",options="header"]
|===
| Name | Description | Default | Priority
| *camel.source.path.name* | Name of DataSet to lookup in the registry | null | HIGH
| *camel.source.endpoint.dataSetIndex* | Controls the behaviour of the CamelDataSetIndex header. For Consumers: - off = the header will not be set - strict/lenient = the header will be set For Producers: - off = the header value will not be verified, and will not be set if it is not present = strict = the header value must be present and will be verified = lenient = the header value will be verified if it is present, and will be set if it is not present One of: [strict] [lenient] [off] | "lenient" | MEDIUM
| *camel.source.endpoint.bridgeErrorHandler* | Allows for bridging the consumer to the Camel routing Error Handler, which mean any exceptions occurred while the consumer is trying to pickup incoming messages, or the likes, will now be processed as a message and handled by the routing Error Handler. By default the consumer will use the org.apache.camel.spi.ExceptionHandler to deal with exceptions, that will be logged at WARN or ERROR level and ignored. | false | MEDIUM
| *camel.source.endpoint.initialDelay* | Time period in millis to wait before starting sending messages. | 1000L | MEDIUM
| *camel.source.endpoint.minRate* | Wait until the DataSet contains at least this number of messages | 0 | MEDIUM
| *camel.source.endpoint.preloadSize* | Sets how many messages should be preloaded (sent) before the route completes its initialization | 0L | MEDIUM
| *camel.source.endpoint.produceDelay* | Allows a delay to be specified which causes a delay when a message is sent by the consumer (to simulate slow processing) | 3L | MEDIUM
| *camel.source.endpoint.exceptionHandler* | To let the consumer use a custom ExceptionHandler. Notice if the option bridgeErrorHandler is enabled then this option is not in use. By default the consumer will deal with exceptions, that will be logged at WARN or ERROR level and ignored. | null | MEDIUM
| *camel.source.endpoint.exchangePattern* | Sets the exchange pattern when the consumer creates an exchange. One of: [InOnly] [InOut] [InOptionalOut] | null | MEDIUM
| *camel.source.endpoint.basicPropertyBinding* | Whether the endpoint should use basic property binding (Camel 2.x) or the newer property binding with additional capabilities | false | MEDIUM
| *camel.source.endpoint.synchronous* | Sets whether synchronous processing should be strictly used, or Camel is allowed to use asynchronous processing (if supported). | false | MEDIUM
| *camel.component.dataset.bridgeErrorHandler* | Allows for bridging the consumer to the Camel routing Error Handler, which mean any exceptions occurred while the consumer is trying to pickup incoming messages, or the likes, will now be processed as a message and handled by the routing Error Handler. By default the consumer will use the org.apache.camel.spi.ExceptionHandler to deal with exceptions, that will be logged at WARN or ERROR level and ignored. | false | MEDIUM
| *camel.component.dataset.basicPropertyBinding* | Whether the component should use basic property binding (Camel 2.x) or the newer property binding with additional capabilities | false | MEDIUM
