= camel-vertx-websocket-kafka-connector sink configuration

When using camel-vertx-websocket-kafka-connector as sink make sure to use the following Maven dependency to have support for the connector:

[source,xml]
----
<dependency>
  <groupId>org.apache.camel.kafkaconnector</groupId>
  <artifactId>camel-vertx-websocket-kafka-connector</artifactId>
  <version>x.x.x</version>
  <!-- use the same version as your Camel Kafka connector version -->
</dependency>
----

To use this Sink connector in Kafka connect you'll need to set the following connector.class

[source,java]
----
connector.class=org.apache.camel.kafkaconnector.vertxwebsocket.CamelVertxwebsocketSinkConnector
----


The camel-vertx-websocket sink connector supports 15 options, which are listed below.



[width="100%",cols="2,5,^1,2",options="header"]
|===
| Name | Description | Default | Priority
| *camel.sink.path.host* | The host that the consumer should bind to or the host of the remote websocket destination that the producer should connect to | "0.0.0.0" | MEDIUM
| *camel.sink.path.port* | The port that the consumer should bind to or port of the remote websocket destination that the producer should connect to | 0 | MEDIUM
| *camel.sink.path.path* | The path that the consumer should bind to or path of the remote websocket destination that the producer should connect to | "/" | HIGH
| *camel.sink.endpoint.clientOptions* | Sets customized options for configuring the WebSocket client used in the producer | null | MEDIUM
| *camel.sink.endpoint.lazyStartProducer* | Whether the producer should be started lazy (on the first message). By starting lazy you can use this to allow CamelContext and routes to startup in situations where a producer may otherwise fail during starting and cause the route to fail being started. By deferring this startup to be lazy then the startup failure can be handled during routing messages via Camel's routing error handlers. Beware that when the first message is processed then creating and starting the producer may take a little time and prolong the total processing time of the processing. | false | MEDIUM
| *camel.sink.endpoint.sendToAll* | To send to all websocket subscribers. Can be used to configure on endpoint level, instead of having to use the VertxWebsocketConstants.SEND_TO_ALL header on the message. | false | MEDIUM
| *camel.sink.endpoint.basicPropertyBinding* | Whether the endpoint should use basic property binding (Camel 2.x) or the newer property binding with additional capabilities | false | MEDIUM
| *camel.sink.endpoint.synchronous* | Sets whether synchronous processing should be strictly used, or Camel is allowed to use asynchronous processing (if supported). | false | MEDIUM
| *camel.sink.endpoint.sslContextParameters* | To configure security using SSLContextParameters | null | MEDIUM
| *camel.component.vertx-websocket.lazyStartProducer* | Whether the producer should be started lazy (on the first message). By starting lazy you can use this to allow CamelContext and routes to startup in situations where a producer may otherwise fail during starting and cause the route to fail being started. By deferring this startup to be lazy then the startup failure can be handled during routing messages via Camel's routing error handlers. Beware that when the first message is processed then creating and starting the producer may take a little time and prolong the total processing time of the processing. | false | MEDIUM
| *camel.component.vertx-websocket.basicProperty Binding* | Whether the component should use basic property binding (Camel 2.x) or the newer property binding with additional capabilities | false | LOW
| *camel.component.vertx-websocket.router* | To provide a custom vertx router to use on the WebSocket server | null | MEDIUM
| *camel.component.vertx-websocket.vertx* | To use an existing vertx instead of creating a new instance | null | MEDIUM
| *camel.component.vertx-websocket.vertxOptions* | To provide a custom set of vertx options for configuring vertx | null | MEDIUM
| *camel.component.vertx-websocket.useGlobalSsl ContextParameters* | Enable usage of global SSL context parameters. | false | MEDIUM
