<dependency>
  <groupId>org.apache.camel.kafkaconnector</groupId>
  <artifactId>camel-salesforce-kafka-connector</artifactId>
  <version>x.x.x</version>
  <!-- use the same version as your Camel Kafka connector version -->
</dependency>
----

To use this Sink connector in Kafka connect you'll need to set the following connector.class

[source,java]
----
connector.class=org.apache.camel.kafkaconnector.salesforce.CamelSalesforceSinkConnector

You would generally set this to the (default) false and authenticate early and be immediately aware of any authentication issues. | false | false | MEDIUM
