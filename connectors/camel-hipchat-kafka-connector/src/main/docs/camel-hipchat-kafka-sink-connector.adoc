[width="100%",cols="2,5,^1,2",options="header"]
|===
| Name | Description | Default | Priority
| *camel.sink.path.protocol* | The protocol for the hipchat server, such as http. | null | HIGH
| *camel.sink.path.host* | The host for the hipchat server, such as api.hipchat.com | null | HIGH
| *camel.sink.path.port* | The port for the hipchat server. Is by default 80. | "80" | MEDIUM
| *camel.sink.endpoint.authToken* | OAuth 2 auth token | null | MEDIUM
| *camel.sink.endpoint.consumeUsers* | Username(s) when consuming messages from the hiptchat server. Multiple user names can be separated by comma. | null | MEDIUM
| *camel.sink.endpoint.httpClient* | The CloseableHttpClient reference from registry to be used during API HTTP requests. | "CloseableHttpClient default from HttpClient library" | MEDIUM
| *camel.sink.endpoint.lazyStartProducer* | Whether the producer should be started lazy (on the first message). By starting lazy you can use this to allow CamelContext and routes to startup in situations where a producer may otherwise fail during starting and cause the route to fail being started. By deferring this startup to be lazy then the startup failure can be handled during routing messages via Camel's routing error handlers. Beware that when the first message is processed then creating and starting the producer may take a little time and prolong the total processing time of the processing. | false | MEDIUM
| *camel.sink.endpoint.basicPropertyBinding* | Whether the endpoint should use basic property binding (Camel 2.x) or the newer property binding with additional capabilities | false | MEDIUM
| *camel.sink.endpoint.synchronous* | Sets whether synchronous processing should be strictly used, or Camel is allowed to use asynchronous processing (if supported). | false | MEDIUM
| *camel.component.hipchat.lazyStartProducer* | Whether the producer should be started lazy (on the first message). By starting lazy you can use this to allow CamelContext and routes to startup in situations where a producer may otherwise fail during starting and cause the route to fail being started. By deferring this startup to be lazy then the startup failure can be handled during routing messages via Camel's routing error handlers. Beware that when the first message is processed then creating and starting the producer may take a little time and prolong the total processing time of the processing. | false | MEDIUM
| *camel.component.hipchat.basicPropertyBinding* | Whether the component should use basic property binding (Camel 2.x) or the newer property binding with additional capabilities | false | LOW
