Connector Description: Store and retrieve data from AWS DynamoDB service using AWS SDK version 2.x.

When using camel-aws2-ddb-kafka-connector as sink make sure to use the following Maven dependency to have support for the connector:

[source,xml]
----
<dependency>
  <groupId>org.apache.camel.kafkaconnector</groupId>
  <artifactId>camel-aws2-ddb-kafka-connector</artifactId>
  <version>x.x.x</version>
  <!-- use the same version as your Camel Kafka connector version -->
</dependency>
----

To use this Sink connector in Kafka connect you'll need to set the following connector.class

[source,java]
----
connector.class=org.apache.camel.kafkaconnector.aws2ddb.CamelAws2ddbSinkConnector
----


The camel-aws2-ddb sink connector supports 37 options, which are listed below.

|===
| Name | Description | Default | Required | Priority
| *camel.sink.path.tableName* | The name of the table currently worked with. | null | true | HIGH
| *camel.sink.endpoint.amazonDDBClient* | To use the AmazonDynamoDB as the client | null | false | MEDIUM
| *camel.sink.endpoint.consistentRead* | Determines whether or not strong consistency should be enforced when data is read. | false | false | MEDIUM
| *camel.sink.endpoint.keyAttributeName* | Attribute name when creating table | null | false | MEDIUM
| *camel.sink.endpoint.keyAttributeType* | Attribute type when creating table | null | false | MEDIUM
| *camel.sink.endpoint.lazyStartProducer* | Whether the producer should be started lazy (on the first message). By starting lazy you can use this to allow CamelContext and routes to startup in situations where a producer may otherwise fail during starting and cause the route to fail being started. By deferring this startup to be lazy then the startup failure can be handled during routing messages via Camel's routing error handlers. Beware that when the first message is processed then creating and starting the producer may take a little time and prolong the total processing time of the processing. | false | false | MEDIUM
| *camel.sink.endpoint.operation* | What operation to perform One of: [BatchGetItems] [DeleteItem] [DeleteTable] [DescribeTable] [GetItem] [PutItem] [Query] [Scan] [UpdateItem] [UpdateTable] | "PutItem" | false | MEDIUM
| *camel.sink.endpoint.overrideEndpoint* | Set the need for overidding the endpoint. This option needs to be used in combination with uriEndpointOverride option | false | false | MEDIUM
| *camel.sink.endpoint.proxyHost* | To define a proxy host when instantiating the DDB client | null | false | MEDIUM
| *camel.sink.endpoint.proxyPort* | The region in which DynamoDB client needs to work. When using this parameter, the configuration will expect the lowercase name of the region (for example ap-east-1) You'll need to use the name Region.EU_WEST_1.id() | null | false | MEDIUM
| *camel.sink.endpoint.proxyProtocol* | To define a proxy protocol when instantiating the DDB client One of: [HTTP] [HTTPS] | "HTTPS" | false | MEDIUM
| *camel.sink.endpoint.readCapacity* | The provisioned throughput to reserve for reading resources from your table | null | false | MEDIUM
| *camel.sink.endpoint.region* | The region in which DDB client needs to work | null | false | MEDIUM
| *camel.sink.endpoint.trustAllCertificates* | If we want to trust all certificates in case of overriding the endpoint | false | false | MEDIUM
| *camel.sink.endpoint.uriEndpointOverride* | Set the overriding uri endpoint. This option needs to be used in combination with overrideEndpoint option | null | false | MEDIUM
| *camel.sink.endpoint.writeCapacity* | The provisioned throughput to reserved for writing resources to your table | null | false | MEDIUM

| *camel.component.aws2-ddb.autowiredEnabled* | Whether autowiring is enabled. This is used for automatic autowiring options (the option must be marked as autowired) by looking up in the registry to find if there is a single instance of matching type, which then gets configured on the component. This can be used for automatic configuring JDBC data sources, JMS connection factories, AWS Clients, etc. | true | false | MEDIUM
