Notice that if you also have transferExchange enabled, this option takes precedence. The caught exception is required to be serializable. The original Exception on the consumer side can be wrapped in an outer exception such as org.apache.camel.RuntimeCamelException when returned to the producer. Use this with caution as the data is using Java Object serialization and requires the received to be able to deserialize the data at Class level, which forces a strong coupling between the producers and consumer!",

Depending on the Java EE transaction context, the container makes its own decisions on these values. Analogously, these parameters are not taken into account within a locally managed transaction either, since Spring JMS operates on an existing JMS Session in this case. Setting this flag to true will use a short local JMS transaction when running outside of a managed transaction, and a synchronized local JMS transaction in case of a managed transaction (other than an XA transaction) being present. This has the effect of a local JMS transaction being managed alongside the main transaction (which might be a native JDBC transaction), with the JMS transaction committing right after the main transaction.",
