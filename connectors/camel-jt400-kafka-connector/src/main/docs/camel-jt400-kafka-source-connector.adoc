When using camel-jt400-kafka-connector as source make sure to use the following Maven dependency to have support for the connector:

[source,xml]
----
<dependency>
  <groupId>org.apache.camel.kafkaconnector</groupId>
  <artifactId>camel-jt400-kafka-connector</artifactId>
  <version>x.x.x</version>
  <!-- use the same version as your Camel Kafka connector version -->
</dependency>
----

To use this Source connector in Kafka connect you'll need to set the following connector.class

[source,java]
----
connector.class=org.apache.camel.kafkaconnector.jt400.CamelJt400SourceConnector

|===
| Name | Description | Default | Priority
| *camel.source.path.userID* | Returns the ID of the IBM i user. | null | HIGH
| *camel.source.path.password* | Returns the password of the IBM i user. | null | HIGH
| *camel.source.path.systemName* | Returns the name of the IBM i system. | null | HIGH
| *camel.source.path.objectPath* | Returns the fully qualified integrated file system path name of the target object of this endpoint. | null | HIGH
| *camel.source.path.type* | Whether to work with data queues or remote program call One of: [DTAQ] [PGM] [SRVPGM] [MSGQ] | null | HIGH
| *camel.source.endpoint.ccsid* | Sets the CCSID to use for the connection with the IBM i system. | null | MEDIUM
| *camel.source.endpoint.format* | Sets the data format for sending messages. One of: [text] [binary] | "text" | MEDIUM
| *camel.source.endpoint.guiAvailable* | Sets whether IBM i prompting is enabled in the environment running Camel. | false | MEDIUM
| *camel.source.endpoint.keyed* | Whether to use keyed or non-keyed data queues. | false | MEDIUM
| *camel.source.endpoint.searchKey* | Search key for keyed data queues. | null | MEDIUM
| *camel.source.endpoint.bridgeErrorHandler* | Allows for bridging the consumer to the Camel routing Error Handler, which mean any exceptions occurred while the consumer is trying to pickup incoming messages, or the likes, will now be processed as a message and handled by the routing Error Handler. By default the consumer will use the org.apache.camel.spi.ExceptionHandler to deal with exceptions, that will be logged at WARN or ERROR level and ignored. | false | MEDIUM
| *camel.source.endpoint.messageAction* | Action to be taken on messages when read from a message queue. Messages can be marked as old (OLD), removed from the queue (REMOVE), or neither (SAME). One of: [OLD] [REMOVE] [SAME] | "OLD" | MEDIUM
| *camel.source.endpoint.readTimeout* | Timeout in millis the consumer will wait while trying to read a new message of the data queue. | 30000 | MEDIUM
| *camel.source.endpoint.searchType* | Search type such as EQ for equal etc. One of: [EQ] [NE] [LT] [LE] [GT] [GE] | "EQ" | MEDIUM
| *camel.source.endpoint.sendEmptyMessageWhenIdle* | If the polling consumer did not poll any files, you can enable this option to send an empty message (no body) instead. | false | MEDIUM
| *camel.source.endpoint.exceptionHandler* | To let the consumer use a custom ExceptionHandler. Notice if the option bridgeErrorHandler is enabled then this option is not in use. By default the consumer will deal with exceptions, that will be logged at WARN or ERROR level and ignored. | null | MEDIUM
| *camel.source.endpoint.exchangePattern* | Sets the exchange pattern when the consumer creates an exchange. One of: [InOnly] [InOut] [InOptionalOut] | null | MEDIUM
| *camel.source.endpoint.pollStrategy* | A pluggable org.apache.camel.PollingConsumerPollingStrategy allowing you to provide your custom implementation to control error handling usually occurred during the poll operation before an Exchange have been created and being routed in Camel. | null | MEDIUM
| *camel.source.endpoint.basicPropertyBinding* | Whether the endpoint should use basic property binding (Camel 2.x) or the newer property binding with additional capabilities | false | MEDIUM
| *camel.source.endpoint.synchronous* | Sets whether synchronous processing should be strictly used, or Camel is allowed to use asynchronous processing (if supported). | false | MEDIUM
| *camel.source.endpoint.backoffErrorThreshold* | The number of subsequent error polls (failed due some error) that should happen before the backoffMultipler should kick-in. | null | MEDIUM
| *camel.source.endpoint.backoffIdleThreshold* | The number of subsequent idle polls that should happen before the backoffMultipler should kick-in. | null | MEDIUM
| *camel.source.endpoint.backoffMultiplier* | To let the scheduled polling consumer backoff if there has been a number of subsequent idles/errors in a row. The multiplier is then the number of polls that will be skipped before the next actual attempt is happening again. When this option is in use then backoffIdleThreshold and/or backoffErrorThreshold must also be configured. | null | MEDIUM
| *camel.source.endpoint.delay* | Milliseconds before the next poll. | 500L | MEDIUM
| *camel.source.endpoint.greedy* | If greedy is enabled, then the ScheduledPollConsumer will run immediately again, if the previous run polled 1 or more messages. | false | MEDIUM
| *camel.source.endpoint.initialDelay* | Milliseconds before the first poll starts. | 1000L | MEDIUM
| *camel.source.endpoint.repeatCount* | Specifies a maximum limit of number of fires. So if you set it to 1, the scheduler will only fire once. If you set it to 5, it will only fire five times. A value of zero or negative means fire forever. | 0L | MEDIUM
| *camel.source.endpoint.runLoggingLevel* | The consumer logs a start/complete log line when it polls. This option allows you to configure the logging level for that. One of: [TRACE] [DEBUG] [INFO] [WARN] [ERROR] [OFF] | "TRACE" | MEDIUM
| *camel.source.endpoint.scheduledExecutorService* | Allows for configuring a custom/shared thread pool to use for the consumer. By default each consumer has its own single threaded thread pool. | null | MEDIUM
| *camel.source.endpoint.scheduler* | To use a cron scheduler from either camel-spring or camel-quartz component. Use value spring or quartz for built in scheduler | "none" | MEDIUM
| *camel.source.endpoint.schedulerProperties* | To configure additional properties when using a custom scheduler or any of the Quartz, Spring based scheduler. | null | MEDIUM
| *camel.source.endpoint.startScheduler* | Whether the scheduler should be auto started. | true | MEDIUM
| *camel.source.endpoint.timeUnit* | Time unit for initialDelay and delay options. One of: [NANOSECONDS] [MICROSECONDS] [MILLISECONDS] [SECONDS] [MINUTES] [HOURS] [DAYS] | "MILLISECONDS" | MEDIUM
| *camel.source.endpoint.useFixedDelay* | Controls if fixed delay or fixed rate is used. See ScheduledExecutorService in JDK for details. | true | MEDIUM
| *camel.source.endpoint.secured* | Whether connections to IBM i are secured with SSL. | false | MEDIUM
| *camel.component.jt400.bridgeErrorHandler* | Allows for bridging the consumer to the Camel routing Error Handler, which mean any exceptions occurred while the consumer is trying to pickup incoming messages, or the likes, will now be processed as a message and handled by the routing Error Handler. By default the consumer will use the org.apache.camel.spi.ExceptionHandler to deal with exceptions, that will be logged at WARN or ERROR level and ignored. | false | MEDIUM
| *camel.component.jt400.basicPropertyBinding* | Whether the component should use basic property binding (Camel 2.x) or the newer property binding with additional capabilities | false | LOW
| *camel.component.jt400.connectionPool* | Default connection pool used by the component. Note that this pool is lazily initialized. This is because in a scenario where the user always provides a pool, it would be wasteful for Camel to initialize and keep an idle pool. | null | MEDIUM
