[width="100%",cols="2,5,^1,2",options="header"]
|===
| Name | Description | Default | Priority
| *camel.source.path.protocol* | The protocol to use which is either http, https or proxy - a consumer only option. One of: [http] [https] | null | HIGH
| *camel.source.path.host* | The local hostname such as localhost, or 0.0.0.0 when being a consumer. The remote HTTP server hostname when using producer. | null | HIGH
| *camel.source.path.port* | The host port number | null | MEDIUM
| *camel.source.path.path* | Resource path | null | MEDIUM
| *camel.source.endpoint.bridgeEndpoint* | If the option is true, the producer will ignore the Exchange.HTTP_URI header, and use the endpoint's URI for request. You may also set the throwExceptionOnFailure to be false to let the producer send all the fault response back. The consumer working in the bridge mode will skip the gzip compression and WWW URL form encoding (by adding the Exchange.SKIP_GZIP_ENCODING and Exchange.SKIP_WWW_FORM_URLENCODED headers to the consumed exchange). | false | MEDIUM
| *camel.source.endpoint.disconnect* | Whether or not to disconnect(close) from Netty Channel right after use. Can be used for both consumer and producer. | false | MEDIUM
| *camel.source.endpoint.keepAlive* | Setting to ensure socket is not closed due to inactivity | true | MEDIUM
| *camel.source.endpoint.reuseAddress* | Setting to facilitate socket multiplexing | true | MEDIUM
| *camel.source.endpoint.reuseChannel* | This option allows producers and consumers (in client mode) to reuse the same Netty Channel for the lifecycle of processing the Exchange. This is useful if you need to call a server multiple times in a Camel route and want to use the same network connection. When using this, the channel is not returned to the connection pool until the Exchange is done; or disconnected if the disconnect option is set to true. The reused Channel is stored on the Exchange as an exchange property with the key NettyConstants#NETTY_CHANNEL which allows you to obtain the channel during routing and use it as well. | false | MEDIUM
| *camel.source.endpoint.sync* | Setting to set endpoint as one-way or request-response | true | MEDIUM
| *camel.source.endpoint.tcpNoDelay* | Setting to improve TCP protocol performance | true | MEDIUM
| *camel.source.endpoint.bridgeErrorHandler* | Allows for bridging the consumer to the Camel routing Error Handler, which mean any exceptions occurred while the consumer is trying to pickup incoming messages, or the likes, will now be processed as a message and handled by the routing Error Handler. By default the consumer will use the org.apache.camel.spi.ExceptionHandler to deal with exceptions, that will be logged at WARN or ERROR level and ignored. | false | MEDIUM
| *camel.source.endpoint.matchOnUriPrefix* | Whether or not Camel should try to find a target consumer by matching the URI prefix if no exact match is found. | false | MEDIUM
| *camel.source.endpoint.muteException* | If enabled and an Exchange failed processing on the consumer side the response's body won't contain the exception's stack trace. | false | MEDIUM
| *camel.source.endpoint.send503whenSuspended* | Whether to send back HTTP status code 503 when the consumer has been suspended. If the option is false then the Netty Acceptor is unbound when the consumer is suspended, so clients cannot connect anymore. | true | MEDIUM
| *camel.source.endpoint.backlog* | Allows to configure a backlog for netty consumer (server). Note the backlog is just a best effort depending on the OS. Setting this option to a value such as 200, 500 or 1000, tells the TCP stack how long the accept queue can be If this option is not configured, then the backlog depends on OS setting. | null | MEDIUM
| *camel.source.endpoint.bossCount* | When netty works on nio mode, it uses default bossCount parameter from Netty, which is 1. User can use this option to override the default bossCount from Netty | 1 | MEDIUM
| *camel.source.endpoint.bossGroup* | Set the BossGroup which could be used for handling the new connection of the server side across the NettyEndpoint | null | MEDIUM
| *camel.source.endpoint.chunkedMaxContentLength* | Value in bytes the max content length per chunked frame received on the Netty HTTP server. | 1048576 | MEDIUM
| *camel.source.endpoint.compression* | Allow using gzip/deflate for compression on the Netty HTTP server if the client supports it from the HTTP headers. | false | MEDIUM
| *camel.source.endpoint.disconnectOnNoReply* | If sync is enabled then this option dictates NettyConsumer if it should disconnect where there is no reply to send back. | true | MEDIUM
| *camel.source.endpoint.exceptionHandler* | To let the consumer use a custom ExceptionHandler. Notice if the option bridgeErrorHandler is enabled then this option is not in use. By default the consumer will deal with exceptions, that will be logged at WARN or ERROR level and ignored. | null | MEDIUM
| *camel.source.endpoint.exchangePattern* | Sets the exchange pattern when the consumer creates an exchange. One of: [InOnly] [InOut] [InOptionalOut] | null | MEDIUM
| *camel.source.endpoint.httpMethodRestrict* | To disable HTTP methods on the Netty HTTP consumer. You can specify multiple separated by comma. | null | MEDIUM
| *camel.source.endpoint.logWarnOnBadRequest* | Whether Netty HTTP server should log a WARN if decoding the HTTP request failed and a HTTP Status 400 (bad request) is returned. | true | MEDIUM
| *camel.source.endpoint.mapHeaders* | If this option is enabled, then during binding from Netty to Camel Message then the headers will be mapped as well (eg added as header to the Camel Message as well). You can turn off this option to disable this. The headers can still be accessed from the org.apache.camel.component.netty.http.NettyHttpMessage message with the method getHttpRequest() that returns the Netty HTTP request io.netty.handler.codec.http.HttpRequest instance. | true | MEDIUM
| *camel.source.endpoint.maxHeaderSize* | The maximum length of all headers. If the sum of the length of each header exceeds this value, a io.netty.handler.codec.TooLongFrameException will be raised. | 8192 | MEDIUM
| *camel.source.endpoint.nettyServerBootstrapFactory* | To use a custom NettyServerBootstrapFactory | null | MEDIUM
| *camel.source.endpoint.nettySharedHttpServer* | To use a shared Netty HTTP server. See Netty HTTP Server Example for more details. | null | MEDIUM
| *camel.source.endpoint.noReplyLogLevel* | If sync is enabled this option dictates NettyConsumer which logging level to use when logging a there is no reply to send back. One of: [TRACE] [DEBUG] [INFO] [WARN] [ERROR] [OFF] | "WARN" | MEDIUM
| *camel.source.endpoint.serverClosedChannelException CaughtLogLevel* | If the server (NettyConsumer) catches an java.nio.channels.ClosedChannelException then its logged using this logging level. This is used to avoid logging the closed channel exceptions, as clients can disconnect abruptly and then cause a flood of closed exceptions in the Netty server. One of: [TRACE] [DEBUG] [INFO] [WARN] [ERROR] [OFF] | "DEBUG" | MEDIUM
| *camel.source.endpoint.serverExceptionCaughtLog Level* | If the server (NettyConsumer) catches an exception then its logged using this logging level. One of: [TRACE] [DEBUG] [INFO] [WARN] [ERROR] [OFF] | "WARN" | MEDIUM
| *camel.source.endpoint.serverInitializerFactory* | To use a custom ServerInitializerFactory | null | MEDIUM
| *camel.source.endpoint.traceEnabled* | Specifies whether to enable HTTP TRACE for this Netty HTTP consumer. By default TRACE is turned off. | false | MEDIUM
| *camel.source.endpoint.urlDecodeHeaders* | If this option is enabled, then during binding from Netty to Camel Message then the header values will be URL decoded (eg %20 will be a space character. Notice this option is used by the default org.apache.camel.component.netty.http.NettyHttpBinding and therefore if you implement a custom org.apache.camel.component.netty.http.NettyHttpBinding then you would need to decode the headers accordingly to this option. | false | MEDIUM
| *camel.source.endpoint.usingExecutorService* | Whether to use ordered thread pool, to ensure events are processed orderly on the same channel. | true | MEDIUM
| *camel.source.endpoint.allowSerializedHeaders* | Only used for TCP when transferExchange is true. When set to true, serializable objects in headers and properties will be added to the exchange. Otherwise Camel will exclude any non-serializable objects and log it at WARN level. | false | MEDIUM
| *camel.source.endpoint.basicPropertyBinding* | Whether the endpoint should use basic property binding (Camel 2.x) or the newer property binding with additional capabilities | false | MEDIUM
| *camel.source.endpoint.channelGroup* | To use a explicit ChannelGroup. | null | MEDIUM
| *camel.source.endpoint.configuration* | To use a custom configured NettyHttpConfiguration for configuring this endpoint. | null | MEDIUM
| *camel.source.endpoint.disableStreamCache* | Determines whether or not the raw input stream from Netty HttpRequest#getContent() or HttpResponset#getContent() is cached or not (Camel will read the stream into a in light-weight memory based Stream caching) cache. By default Camel will cache the Netty input stream to support reading it multiple times to ensure it Camel can retrieve all data from the stream. However you can set this option to true when you for example need to access the raw stream, such as streaming it directly to a file or other persistent store. Mind that if you enable this option, then you cannot read the Netty stream multiple times out of the box, and you would need manually to reset the reader index on the Netty raw stream. Also Netty will auto-close the Netty stream when the Netty HTTP server/HTTP client is done processing, which means that if the asynchronous routing engine is in use then any asynchronous thread that may continue routing the org.apache.camel.Exchange may not be able to read the Netty stream, because Netty has closed it. | false | MEDIUM
| *camel.source.endpoint.headerFilterStrategy* | To use a custom org.apache.camel.spi.HeaderFilterStrategy to filter headers. | null | MEDIUM
| *camel.source.endpoint.nativeTransport* | Whether to use native transport instead of NIO. Native transport takes advantage of the host operating system and is only supported on some platforms. You need to add the netty JAR for the host operating system you are using. See more details at: \http://netty.io/wiki/native-transports.html | false | MEDIUM
| *camel.source.endpoint.nettyHttpBinding* | To use a custom org.apache.camel.component.netty.http.NettyHttpBinding for binding to/from Netty and Camel Message API. | null | MEDIUM
| *camel.source.endpoint.options* | Allows to configure additional netty options using option. as prefix. For example option.child.keepAlive=false to set the netty option child.keepAlive=false. See the Netty documentation for possible options that can be used. | null | MEDIUM
| *camel.source.endpoint.receiveBufferSize* | The TCP/UDP buffer sizes to be used during inbound communication. Size is bytes. | 65536 | MEDIUM
| *camel.source.endpoint.receiveBufferSizePredictor* | Configures the buffer size predictor. See details at Jetty documentation and this mail thread. | null | MEDIUM
| *camel.source.endpoint.sendBufferSize* | The TCP/UDP buffer sizes to be used during outbound communication. Size is bytes. | 65536 | MEDIUM
| *camel.source.endpoint.synchronous* | Sets whether synchronous processing should be strictly used, or Camel is allowed to use asynchronous processing (if supported). | false | MEDIUM
| *camel.source.endpoint.transferException* | If enabled and an Exchange failed processing on the consumer side, and if the caused Exception was send back serialized in the response as a application/x-java-serialized-object content type. On the producer side the exception will be deserialized and thrown as is, instead of the HttpOperationFailedException. The caused exception is required to be serialized. This is by default turned off. If you enable this then be aware that Java will deserialize the incoming data from the request to Java and that can be a potential security risk. | false | MEDIUM
| *camel.source.endpoint.transferExchange* | Only used for TCP. You can transfer the exchange over the wire instead of just the body. The following fields are transferred: In body, Out body, fault body, In headers, Out headers, fault headers, exchange properties, exchange exception. This requires that the objects are serializable. Camel will exclude any non-serializable objects and log it at WARN level. | false | MEDIUM
| *camel.source.endpoint.workerCount* | When netty works on nio mode, it uses default workerCount parameter from Netty (which is cpu_core_threads x 2). User can use this option to override the default workerCount from Netty. | null | MEDIUM
| *camel.source.endpoint.workerGroup* | To use a explicit EventLoopGroup as the boss thread pool. For example to share a thread pool with multiple consumers or producers. By default each consumer or producer has their own worker pool with 2 x cpu count core threads. | null | MEDIUM
| *camel.source.endpoint.decoders* | A list of decoders to be used. You can use a String which have values separated by comma, and have the values be looked up in the Registry. Just remember to prefix the value with # so Camel knows it should lookup. | null | MEDIUM
| *camel.source.endpoint.encoders* | A list of encoders to be used. You can use a String which have values separated by comma, and have the values be looked up in the Registry. Just remember to prefix the value with # so Camel knows it should lookup. | null | MEDIUM

| *camel.source.endpoint.sslContextParameters* | To configure security using SSLContextParameters | null | MEDIUM
| *camel.source.endpoint.sslHandler* | Reference to a class that could be used to return an SSL Handler | null | MEDIUM
| *camel.source.endpoint.trustStoreFile* | Server side certificate keystore to be used for encryption | null | MEDIUM
| *camel.source.endpoint.trustStoreResource* | Server side certificate keystore to be used for encryption. Is loaded by default from classpath, but you can prefix with classpath:, file:, or http: to load the resource from different systems. | null | MEDIUM

By default the consumer will use the org.apache.camel.spi.ExceptionHandler to deal with exceptions, that will be logged at WARN or ERROR level and ignored. | false | MEDIUM
| *camel.component.netty-http.broadcast* | Setting to choose Multicast over UDP | false | MEDIUM
| *camel.component.netty-http.clientMode* | If the clientMode is true, netty consumer will connect the address as a TCP client. | false | MEDIUM
| *camel.component.netty-http.reconnect* | Used only in clientMode in consumer, the consumer will attempt to reconnect on disconnection if this is enabled | true | MEDIUM

Setting this value to eg 10 will then use 10 threads unless 2 x cpu_core plus 1 is a higher value, which then will override and be used. For example if there are 8 cores, then the consumer thread pool will be 17. This thread pool is used to route messages received from Netty by Camel. We use a separate thread pool to ensure ordering of messages and also in case some messages will block, then nettys worker threads (event loop) wont be affected. | null | MEDIUM
| *camel.component.netty-http.nettyServerBootstrap Factory* | To use a custom NettyServerBootstrapFactory | null | MEDIUM
