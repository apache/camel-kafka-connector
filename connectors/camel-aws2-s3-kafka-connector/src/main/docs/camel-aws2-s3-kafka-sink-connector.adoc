= camel-aws2-s3-kafka-connector sink configuration

When using camel-aws2-s3-kafka-connector as sink make sure to use the following Maven dependency to have support for the connector:

[source,xml]
----
<dependency>
  <groupId>org.apache.camel.kafkaconnector</groupId>
  <artifactId>camel-aws2-s3-kafka-connector</artifactId>
  <version>x.x.x</version>
  <!-- use the same version as your Camel Kafka connector version -->
</dependency>
----

To use this Sink connector in Kafka connect you'll need to set the following connector.class

[source,java]

|===
| Name | Description | Default | Priority
| *camel.sink.path.bucketNameOrArn* | Bucket name or ARN | null | HIGH
| *camel.sink.endpoint.amazonS3Client* | Reference to a com.amazonaws.services.s3.AmazonS3 in the registry. | null | MEDIUM
| *camel.sink.endpoint.autoCreateBucket* | Setting the autocreation of the S3 bucket bucketName. This will apply also in case of moveAfterRead option enabled and it will create the destinationBucket if it doesn't exist already. | true | MEDIUM
| *camel.sink.endpoint.autoDiscoverClient* | Setting the autoDiscoverClient mechanism, if true, the component will look for a client instance in the registry automatically otherwise it will skip that checking. | true | MEDIUM
| *camel.sink.endpoint.overrideEndpoint* | Set the need for overidding the endpoint. This option needs to be used in combination with uriEndpointOverride option | false | MEDIUM
| *camel.sink.endpoint.pojoRequest* | If we want to use a POJO request as body or not | false | MEDIUM
| *camel.sink.endpoint.policy* | The policy for this queue to set in the com.amazonaws.services.s3.AmazonS3#setBucketPolicy() method. | null | MEDIUM
| *camel.sink.endpoint.proxyHost* | To define a proxy host when instantiating the SQS client | null | MEDIUM
| *camel.sink.endpoint.proxyPort* | Specify a proxy port to be used inside the client definition. | null | MEDIUM
| *camel.sink.endpoint.proxyProtocol* | To define a proxy protocol when instantiating the S3 client One of: [HTTP] [HTTPS] | "HTTPS" | MEDIUM
| *camel.sink.endpoint.region* | The region in which S3 client needs to work. When using this parameter, the configuration will expect the lowercase name of the region (for example ap-east-1) You'll need to use the name Region.EU_WEST_1.id() | null | MEDIUM
| *camel.sink.endpoint.trustAllCertificates* | If we want to trust all certificates in case of overriding the endpoint | false | MEDIUM
| *camel.sink.endpoint.uriEndpointOverride* | Set the overriding uri endpoint. This option needs to be used in combination with overrideEndpoint option | null | MEDIUM
| *camel.sink.endpoint.useIAMCredentials* | Set whether the S3 client should expect to load credentials on an EC2 instance or to expect static credentials to be passed in. | false | MEDIUM
| *camel.sink.endpoint.customerAlgorithm* | Define the customer algorithm to use in case CustomerKey is enabled | null | MEDIUM
| *camel.sink.endpoint.customerKeyId* | Define the id of Customer key to use in case CustomerKey is enabled | null | MEDIUM

| *camel.sink.endpoint.keyName* | Setting the key name for an element in the bucket through endpoint parameter | null | MEDIUM
| *camel.sink.endpoint.lazyStartProducer* | Whether the producer should be started lazy (on the first message). By starting lazy you can use this to allow CamelContext and routes to startup in situations where a producer may otherwise fail during starting and cause the route to fail being started. By deferring this startup to be lazy then the startup failure can be handled during routing messages via Camel's routing error handlers. Beware that when the first message is processed then creating and starting the producer may take a little time and prolong the total processing time of the processing. | false | MEDIUM
