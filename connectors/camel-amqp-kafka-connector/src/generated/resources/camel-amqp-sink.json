Depending on the Java EE transaction context, the container makes its own decisions on these values. Analogously, these parameters are not taken into account within a locally managed transaction either, since Spring JMS operates on an existing JMS Session in this case. Setting this flag to true will use a short local JMS transaction when running outside of a managed transaction, and a synchronized local JMS transaction in case of a managed transaction (other than an XA transaction) being present.
