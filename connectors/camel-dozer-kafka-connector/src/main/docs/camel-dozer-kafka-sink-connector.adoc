= camel-dozer-kafka-connector sink configuration

When using camel-dozer-kafka-connector as sink make sure to use the following Maven dependency to have support for the connector:

[source,xml]
----
<dependency>
  <groupId>org.apache.camel.kafkaconnector</groupId>
  <artifactId>camel-dozer-kafka-connector</artifactId>
  <version>x.x.x</version>
  <!-- use the same version as your Camel Kafka connector version -->
</dependency>
----

To use this Sink connector in Kafka connect you'll need to set the following connector.class

[source,java]
----
connector.class=org.apache.camel.kafkaconnector.dozer.CamelDozerSinkConnector
----


The camel-dozer sink connector supports 12 options, which are listed below.



[width="100%",cols="2,5,^1,2",options="header"]
|===
| Name | Description | Default | Priority
| *camel.sink.path.name* | A human readable name of the mapping. | null | HIGH
| *camel.sink.endpoint.lazyStartProducer* | Whether the producer should be started lazy (on the first message). By starting lazy you can use this to allow CamelContext and routes to startup in situations where a producer may otherwise fail during starting and cause the route to fail being started. By deferring this startup to be lazy then the startup failure can be handled during routing messages via Camel's routing error handlers. Beware that when the first message is processed then creating and starting the producer may take a little time and prolong the total processing time of the processing. | false | MEDIUM
| *camel.sink.endpoint.mappingConfiguration* | The name of a DozerBeanMapperConfiguration bean in the Camel registry which should be used for configuring the Dozer mapping. This is an alternative to the mappingFile option that can be used for fine-grained control over how Dozer is configured. Remember to use a # prefix in the value to indicate that the bean is in the Camel registry (e.g. #myDozerConfig). | null | MEDIUM
| *camel.sink.endpoint.mappingFile* | The location of a Dozer configuration file. The file is loaded from the classpath by default, but you can use file:, classpath:, or http: to load the configuration from a specific location. | "dozerBeanMapping.xml" | MEDIUM
| *camel.sink.endpoint.marshalId* | The id of a dataFormat defined within the Camel Context to use for marshalling the mapping output to a non-Java type. | null | MEDIUM
| *camel.sink.endpoint.sourceModel* | Fully-qualified class name for the source type used in the mapping. If specified, the input to the mapping is converted to the specified type before being mapped with Dozer. | null | MEDIUM
| *camel.sink.endpoint.targetModel* | Fully-qualified class name for the target type used in the mapping. | null | HIGH
| *camel.sink.endpoint.unmarshalId* | The id of a dataFormat defined within the Camel Context to use for unmarshalling the mapping input from a non-Java type. | null | MEDIUM
| *camel.sink.endpoint.basicPropertyBinding* | Whether the endpoint should use basic property binding (Camel 2.x) or the newer property binding with additional capabilities | false | MEDIUM
| *camel.sink.endpoint.synchronous* | Sets whether synchronous processing should be strictly used, or Camel is allowed to use asynchronous processing (if supported). | false | MEDIUM
| *camel.component.dozer.lazyStartProducer* | Whether the producer should be started lazy (on the first message). By starting lazy you can use this to allow CamelContext and routes to startup in situations where a producer may otherwise fail during starting and cause the route to fail being started. By deferring this startup to be lazy then the startup failure can be handled during routing messages via Camel's routing error handlers. Beware that when the first message is processed then creating and starting the producer may take a little time and prolong the total processing time of the processing. | false | MEDIUM
| *camel.component.dozer.basicPropertyBinding* | Whether the component should use basic property binding (Camel 2.x) or the newer property binding with additional capabilities | false | LOW
