= camel-zookeeper-kafka-connector sink configuration

When using camel-zookeeper-kafka-connector as sink make sure to use the following Maven dependency to have support for the connector:

[source,xml]
----
<dependency>
  <groupId>org.apache.camel.kafkaconnector</groupId>
  <artifactId>camel-zookeeper-kafka-connector</artifactId>
  <version>x.x.x</version>
  <!-- use the same version as your Camel Kafka connector version -->
</dependency>
----

To use this Sink connector in Kafka connect you'll need to set the following connector.class

[source,java]
----
connector.class=org.apache.camel.kafkaconnector.zookeeper.CamelZookeeperSinkConnector
----


The camel-zookeeper sink connector supports 14 options, which are listed below.



[width="100%",cols="2,5,^1,1,1",options="header"]
|===
| Name | Description | Default | Required | Priority
| *camel.sink.path.serverUrls* | The zookeeper server hosts (multiple servers can be separated by comma) | null | true | HIGH
| *camel.sink.path.path* | The node in the ZooKeeper server (aka znode) | null | true | HIGH
| *camel.sink.endpoint.listChildren* | Whether the children of the node should be listed | false | false | MEDIUM
| *camel.sink.endpoint.timeout* | The time interval to wait on connection before timing out. | 5000 | false | MEDIUM
| *camel.sink.endpoint.create* | Should the endpoint create the node if it does not currently exist. | false | false | MEDIUM
| *camel.sink.endpoint.createMode* | The create mode that should be used for the newly created node One of: [PERSISTENT] [PERSISTENT_SEQUENTIAL] [EPHEMERAL] [EPHEMERAL_SEQUENTIAL] | "EPHEMERAL" | false | MEDIUM
| *camel.sink.endpoint.lazyStartProducer* | Whether the producer should be started lazy (on the first message). By starting lazy you can use this to allow CamelContext and routes to startup in situations where a producer may otherwise fail during starting and cause the route to fail being started. By deferring this startup to be lazy then the startup failure can be handled during routing messages via Camel's routing error handlers. Beware that when the first message is processed then creating and starting the producer may take a little time and prolong the total processing time of the processing. | false | false | MEDIUM
| *camel.component.zookeeper.listChildren* | Whether the children of the node should be listed | false | false | MEDIUM
| *camel.component.zookeeper.timeout* | The time interval to wait on connection before timing out. | 5000 | false | MEDIUM
| *camel.component.zookeeper.create* | Should the endpoint create the node if it does not currently exist. | false | false | MEDIUM
| *camel.component.zookeeper.createMode* | The create mode that should be used for the newly created node One of: [PERSISTENT] [PERSISTENT_SEQUENTIAL] [EPHEMERAL] [EPHEMERAL_SEQUENTIAL] | "EPHEMERAL" | false | MEDIUM
| *camel.component.zookeeper.lazyStartProducer* | Whether the producer should be started lazy (on the first message). By starting lazy you can use this to allow CamelContext and routes to startup in situations where a producer may otherwise fail during starting and cause the route to fail being started. By deferring this startup to be lazy then the startup failure can be handled during routing messages via Camel's routing error handlers. Beware that when the first message is processed then creating and starting the producer may take a little time and prolong the total processing time of the processing. | false | false | MEDIUM
| *camel.component.zookeeper.autowiredEnabled* | Whether autowiring is enabled. This is used for automatic autowiring options (the option must be marked as autowired) by looking up in the registry to find if there is a single instance of matching type, which then gets configured on the component. This can be used for automatic configuring JDBC data sources, JMS connection factories, AWS Clients, etc. | true | false | MEDIUM
| *camel.component.zookeeper.configuration* | To use a shared ZooKeeperConfiguration | null | false | MEDIUM
