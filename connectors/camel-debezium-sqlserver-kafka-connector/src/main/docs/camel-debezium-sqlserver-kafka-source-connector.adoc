| *camel.source.endpoint.eventProcessingFailure HandlingMode* | Specify how failures during processing of events (i.e. when encountering a corrupted event) should be handled, including:'fail' (the default) an exception indicating the problematic event and its position is raised, causing the connector to be stopped; 'warn' the problematic event and its position will be logged and the event will be skipped;'ignore' the problematic event will be skipped. | "fail" | MEDIUM

Each expression must match the pattern ':',where the table names could be defined as (DB_NAME.TABLE_NAME) or (SCHEMA_NAME.TABLE_NAME), depending on the specific connector,and the key columns are a comma-separated list of columns representing the custom key. For any table without an explicit key configuration the table's primary key column(s) will be used as message key.Example: dbserver1.inventory.orderlines:orderId,orderLineId;dbserver1.inventory.orders:id | null | MEDIUM

| *camel.source.endpoint.snapshotIsolationMode* | Controls which transaction isolation level is used and how long the connector locks the monitored tables. The default is 'repeatable_read', which means that repeatable read isolation level is used. In addition, exclusive locks are taken only during schema snapshot. Using a value of 'exclusive' ensures that the connector holds the exclusive lock (and thus prevents any reads and updates) for all monitored tables during the entire snapshot duration. When 'snapshot' is specified, connector runs the initial snapshot in SNAPSHOT isolation level, which guarantees snapshot consistency. In addition, neither table nor row-level locks are held. When 'read_committed' is specified, connector runs the initial snapshot in READ COMMITTED isolation level. No long-running locks are taken, so that initial snapshot does not prevent other transactions from updating table rows. Snapshot consistency is not guaranteed.In 'read_uncommitted' mode neither table nor row-level locks are acquired, but connector does not guarantee snapshot consistency. | "repeatable_read" | MEDIUM
| *camel.source.endpoint.snapshotLockTimeoutMs* | The maximum number of millis to wait for table locks at the beginning of a snapshot. If locks cannot be acquired in this time frame, the snapshot will be aborted. Defaults to 10 seconds | 10000L | MEDIUM

Options include: 'initial' (the default) to specify the connector should run a snapshot only when no offsets are available for the logical server name; 'schema_only' to specify the connector should run a snapshot of the schema when no offsets are available for the logical server name. | "initial" | MEDIUM
| *camel.source.endpoint.snapshotSelectStatement Overrides* | This property contains a comma-separated list of fully-qualified tables (DB_NAME.TABLE_NAME) or (SCHEMA_NAME.TABLE_NAME), depending on thespecific connectors . Select statements for the individual tables are specified in further configuration properties, one for each table, identified by the id 'snapshot.select.statement.overrides.DB_NAME.TABLE_NAME' or 'snapshot.select.statement.overrides.SCHEMA_NAME.TABLE_NAME', respectively. The value of those properties is the select statement to use when retrieving data from the specific table during snapshotting. A possible use case for large append-only tables is setting a specific point where to start (resume) snapshotting, in case a previous snapshotting was interrupted. | null | MEDIUM
| *camel.source.endpoint.sourceStructVersion* | A version of the format of the publicly visible source part in the message | "v2" | MEDIUM
| *camel.source.endpoint.sourceTimestampMode* | Configures the criteria of the attached timestamp within the source record (ts_ms).Options include:'commit', (default) the source timestamp is set to the instant where the record was committed in the database'processing', the source timestamp is set to the instant where the record was processed by Debezium. | "commit" | MEDIUM

| *camel.source.endpoint.tombstonesOnDelete* | Whether delete operations should be represented by a delete event and a subsquenttombstone event (true) or only by a delete event (false). Emitting the tombstone event (the default behavior) allows Kafka to completely delete all events pertaining to the given key once the source record got deleted. | false | MEDIUM
| *camel.component.debezium-sqlserver.additional Properties* | Additional properties for debezium components in case they can't be set directly on the camel configurations (e.g: setting Kafka Connect properties needed by Debezium engine, for example setting KafkaOffsetBackingStore), the properties have to be prefixed with additionalProperties.. E.g: additionalProperties.transactional.id=12345&additionalProperties.schema.registry.url=\http://localhost:8811/avro | null | MEDIUM
