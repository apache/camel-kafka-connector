When using camel-thrift-kafka-connector as sink make sure to use the following Maven dependency to have support for the connector:

[source,xml]
----
<dependency>
  <groupId>org.apache.camel.kafkaconnector</groupId>
  <artifactId>camel-thrift-kafka-connector</artifactId>
  <version>x.x.x</version>
  <!-- use the same version as your Camel Kafka connector version -->
</dependency>
----

To use this Sink connector in Kafka connect you'll need to set the following connector.class

[width="100%",cols="2,5,^1,2",options="header"]
|===
| Name | Description | Default | Priority
| *camel.sink.path.host* | The Thrift server host name. This is localhost or 0.0.0.0 (if not defined) when being a consumer or remote server host name when using producer. | null | MEDIUM
| *camel.sink.path.port* | The Thrift server port | null | HIGH
| *camel.sink.path.service* | Fully qualified service name from the thrift descriptor file (package dot service definition name) | null | HIGH
| *camel.sink.endpoint.compressionType* | Protocol compression mechanism type One of: [NONE] [ZLIB] | "NONE" | MEDIUM
| *camel.sink.endpoint.exchangeProtocol* | Exchange protocol serialization type One of: [BINARY] [JSON] [SJSON] [COMPACT] | "BINARY" | MEDIUM
| *camel.sink.endpoint.lazyStartProducer* | Whether the producer should be started lazy (on the first message). By starting lazy you can use this to allow CamelContext and routes to startup in situations where a producer may otherwise fail during starting and cause the route to fail being started. By deferring this startup to be lazy then the startup failure can be handled during routing messages via Camel's routing error handlers. Beware that when the first message is processed then creating and starting the producer may take a little time and prolong the total processing time of the processing. | false | MEDIUM
| *camel.sink.endpoint.method* | The Thrift invoked method name | null | MEDIUM
| *camel.sink.endpoint.basicPropertyBinding* | Whether the endpoint should use basic property binding (Camel 2.x) or the newer property binding with additional capabilities | false | MEDIUM
| *camel.sink.endpoint.synchronous* | Sets whether synchronous processing should be strictly used, or Camel is allowed to use asynchronous processing (if supported). | false | MEDIUM
| *camel.sink.endpoint.negotiationType* | Security negotiation type One of: [PLAINTEXT] [SSL] [SASL] | "PLAINTEXT" | MEDIUM
| *camel.sink.endpoint.sslParameters* | Configuration parameters for SSL/TLS security negotiation | null | MEDIUM
| *camel.component.thrift.lazyStartProducer* | Whether the producer should be started lazy (on the first message). By starting lazy you can use this to allow CamelContext and routes to startup in situations where a producer may otherwise fail during starting and cause the route to fail being started. By deferring this startup to be lazy then the startup failure can be handled during routing messages via Camel's routing error handlers. Beware that when the first message is processed then creating and starting the producer may take a little time and prolong the total processing time of the processing. | false | MEDIUM
| *camel.component.thrift.basicPropertyBinding* | Whether the component should use basic property binding (Camel 2.x) or the newer property binding with additional capabilities | false | LOW
| *camel.component.thrift.useGlobalSslContext Parameters* | Determine if the thrift component is using global SSL context parameters | false | MEDIUM
