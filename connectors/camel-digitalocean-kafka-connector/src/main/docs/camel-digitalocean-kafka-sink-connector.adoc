| Name | Description | Default | Priority
| *camel.sink.path.operation* | The operation to perform to the given resource. One of: [create] [update] [delete] [list] [ownList] [get] [listBackups] [listActions] [listNeighbors] [listSnapshots] [listKernels] [listAllNeighbors] [enableBackups] [disableBackups] [reboot] [powerCycle] [shutdown] [powerOn] [powerOff] [restore] [resetPassword] [resize] [rebuild] [rename] [changeKernel] [enableIpv6] [enablePrivateNetworking] [takeSnapshot] [transfer] [convert] [attach] [detach] [assign] [unassign] [tag] [untag] | null | ConfigDef.Importance.MEDIUM
| *camel.sink.endpoint.lazyStartProducer* | Whether the producer should be started lazy (on the first message). By starting lazy you can use this to allow CamelContext and routes to startup in situations where a producer may otherwise fail during starting and cause the route to fail being started. By deferring this startup to be lazy then the startup failure can be handled during routing messages via Camel's routing error handlers. Beware that when the first message is processed then creating and starting the producer may take a little time and prolong the total processing time of the processing. | false | ConfigDef.Importance.MEDIUM
| *camel.sink.endpoint.page* | Use for pagination. Force the page number. | "1" | ConfigDef.Importance.MEDIUM
| *camel.sink.endpoint.perPage* | Use for pagination. Set the number of item per request. The maximum number of results per page is 200. | "25" | ConfigDef.Importance.MEDIUM
| *camel.sink.endpoint.resource* | The DigitalOcean resource type on which perform the operation. One of: [account] [actions] [blockStorages] [droplets] [mages] [snapshots] [keys] [regions] [sizes] [floatingIPs] [tags] | null | ConfigDef.Importance.HIGH
| *camel.sink.endpoint.basicPropertyBinding* | Whether the endpoint should use basic property binding (Camel 2.x) or the newer property binding with additional capabilities | false | ConfigDef.Importance.MEDIUM
| *camel.sink.endpoint.digitalOceanClient* | To use a existing configured DigitalOceanClient as client | null | ConfigDef.Importance.MEDIUM
| *camel.sink.endpoint.synchronous* | Sets whether synchronous processing should be strictly used, or Camel is allowed to use asynchronous processing (if supported). | false | ConfigDef.Importance.MEDIUM
| *camel.sink.endpoint.httpProxyHost* | Set a proxy host if needed | null | ConfigDef.Importance.MEDIUM
| *camel.sink.endpoint.httpProxyPassword* | Set a proxy password if needed | null | ConfigDef.Importance.MEDIUM
| *camel.sink.endpoint.httpProxyPort* | Set a proxy port if needed | null | ConfigDef.Importance.MEDIUM
| *camel.sink.endpoint.httpProxyUser* | Set a proxy host if needed | null | ConfigDef.Importance.MEDIUM
| *camel.sink.endpoint.oAuthToken* | DigitalOcean OAuth Token | null | ConfigDef.Importance.MEDIUM
| *camel.component.digitalocean.lazyStartProducer* | Whether the producer should be started lazy (on the first message). By starting lazy you can use this to allow CamelContext and routes to startup in situations where a producer may otherwise fail during starting and cause the route to fail being started. By deferring this startup to be lazy then the startup failure can be handled during routing messages via Camel's routing error handlers. Beware that when the first message is processed then creating and starting the producer may take a little time and prolong the total processing time of the processing. | false | ConfigDef.Importance.MEDIUM
| *camel.component.digitalocean.basicPropertyBinding* | Whether the component should use basic property binding (Camel 2.x) or the newer property binding with additional capabilities | false | ConfigDef.Importance.MEDIUM
