| *camel.source.endpoint.snapshotSelectStatement Overrides* | This property contains a comma-separated list of fully-qualified tables (DB_NAME.TABLE_NAME) or (SCHEMA_NAME.TABLE_NAME), depending on thespecific connectors . Select statements for the individual tables are specified in further configuration properties, one for each table, identified by the id 'snapshot.select.statement.overrides.DB_NAME.TABLE_NAME' or 'snapshot.select.statement.overrides.SCHEMA_NAME.TABLE_NAME', respectively. The value of those properties is the select statement to use when retrieving data from the specific table during snapshotting. A possible use case for large append-only tables is setting a specific point where to start (resume) snapshotting, in case a previous snapshotting was interrupted. | null | MEDIUM
| *camel.source.endpoint.sourceStructVersion* | A version of the format of the publicly visible source part in the message | "v2" | MEDIUM
| *camel.source.endpoint.statusUpdateIntervalMs* | Frequency in milliseconds for sending replication connection status updates to the server. Defaults to 10 seconds (10000 ms). | 10000 | MEDIUM

| *camel.source.endpoint.toastedValuePlaceholder* | Specify the constant that will be provided by Debezium to indicate that the original value is a toasted value not provided by the database.If starts with 'hex:' prefix it is expected that the rest of the string repesents hexadecimally encoded octets. | "__debezium_unavailable_value" | MEDIUM
| *camel.source.endpoint.tombstonesOnDelete* | Whether delete operations should be represented by a delete event and a subsquenttombstone event (true) or only by a delete event (false). Emitting the tombstone event (the default behavior) allows Kafka to completely delete all events pertaining to the given key once the source record got deleted. | false | MEDIUM
| *camel.source.endpoint.xminFetchIntervalMs* | Specify how often (in ms) the xmin will be fetched from the replication slot. This xmin value is exposed by the slot which gives a lower bound of where a new replication slot could start from. The lower the value, the more likely this value is to be the current 'true' value, but the bigger the performance cost. The bigger the value, the less likely this value is to be the current 'true' value, but the lower the performance penalty. The default is set to 0 ms, which disables tracking xmin. | 0L | MEDIUM

| *camel.component.debezium-postgres.schemaRefresh Mode* | Specify the conditions that trigger a refresh of the in-memory schema for a table. 'columns_diff' (the default) is the safest mode, ensuring the in-memory schema stays in-sync with the database table's schema at all times. 'columns_diff_exclude_unchanged_toast' instructs the connector to refresh the in-memory schema cache if there is a discrepancy between it and the schema derived from the incoming message, unless unchanged TOASTable data fully accounts for the discrepancy. This setting can improve connector performance significantly if there are frequently-updated tables that have TOASTed data that are rarely part of these updates. However, it is possible for the in-memory schema to become outdated if TOASTable columns are dropped from the table. | "columns_diff" | MEDIUM
| *camel.component.debezium-postgres.schemaWhitelist* | The schemas for which events should be captured | null | MEDIUM
| *camel.component.debezium-postgres.skipped Operations* | The comma-separated list of operations to skip during streaming, defined as: 'i' for inserts; 'u' for updates; 'd' for deletes. By default, no operations will be skipped. | null | MEDIUM
| *camel.component.debezium-postgres.slotDropOnStop* | Whether or not to drop the logical replication slot when the connector finishes orderlyBy default the replication is kept so that on restart progress can resume from the last recorded location | false | MEDIUM
| *camel.component.debezium-postgres.slotMaxRetries* | How many times to retry connecting to a replication slot when an attempt fails. | 6 | MEDIUM
| *camel.component.debezium-postgres.slotName* | The name of the Postgres logical decoding slot created for streaming changes from a plugin.Defaults to 'debezium | "debezium" | MEDIUM
| *camel.component.debezium-postgres.slotRetryDelayMs* | The number of milli-seconds to wait between retry attempts when the connector fails to connect to a replication slot. | 10000L | MEDIUM
| *camel.component.debezium-postgres.slotStreamParams* | Any optional parameters used by logical decoding plugin. Semi-colon separated. E.g. 'add-tables=public.table,public.table2;include-lsn=true' | null | MEDIUM
| *camel.component.debezium-postgres.snapshotCustom Class* | When 'snapshot.mode' is set as custom, this setting must be set to specify a fully qualified class name to load (via the default class loader).This class must implement the 'Snapshotter' interface and is called on each app boot to determine whether to do a snapshot and how to build queries. | null | MEDIUM
| *camel.component.debezium-postgres.snapshotDelayMs* | The number of milliseconds to delay before a snapshot will begin. | 0L | MEDIUM
| *camel.component.debezium-postgres.snapshotFetch Size* | The maximum number of records that should be loaded into memory while performing a snapshot | null | MEDIUM
| *camel.component.debezium-postgres.snapshotLock TimeoutMs* | The maximum number of millis to wait for table locks at the beginning of a snapshot. If locks cannot be acquired in this time frame, the snapshot will be aborted. Defaults to 10 seconds | 10000L | MEDIUM
| *camel.component.debezium-postgres.snapshotMode* | The criteria for running a snapshot upon startup of the connector. Options include: 'always' to specify that the connector run a snapshot each time it starts up; 'initial' (the default) to specify the connector can run a snapshot only when no offsets are available for the logical server name; 'initial_only' same as 'initial' except the connector should stop after completing the snapshot and before it would normally start emitting changes;'never' to specify the connector should never run a snapshot and that upon first startup the connector should read from the last position (LSN) recorded by the server; and'exported' to specify the connector should run a snapshot based on the position when the replication slot was created; 'custom' to specify a custom class with 'snapshot.custom_class' which will be loaded and used to determine the snapshot, see docs for more details. | "initial" | MEDIUM
| *camel.component.debezium-postgres.snapshotSelect StatementOverrides* | This property contains a comma-separated list of fully-qualified tables (DB_NAME.TABLE_NAME) or (SCHEMA_NAME.TABLE_NAME), depending on thespecific connectors . Select statements for the individual tables are specified in further configuration properties, one for each table, identified by the id 'snapshot.select.statement.overrides.DB_NAME.TABLE_NAME' or 'snapshot.select.statement.overrides.SCHEMA_NAME.TABLE_NAME', respectively. The value of those properties is the select statement to use when retrieving data from the specific table during snapshotting. A possible use case for large append-only tables is setting a specific point where to start (resume) snapshotting, in case a previous snapshotting was interrupted. | null | MEDIUM
| *camel.component.debezium-postgres.sourceStruct Version* | A version of the format of the publicly visible source part in the message | "v2" | MEDIUM
| *camel.component.debezium-postgres.statusUpdate IntervalMs* | Frequency in milliseconds for sending replication connection status updates to the server. Defaults to 10 seconds (10000 ms). | 10000 | MEDIUM
| *camel.component.debezium-postgres.tableBlacklist* | Description is not available here, please check Debezium website for corresponding key 'table.blacklist' description. | null | MEDIUM
| *camel.component.debezium-postgres.tableIgnore Builtin* | Flag specifying whether built-in tables should be ignored. | true | MEDIUM
| *camel.component.debezium-postgres.tableWhitelist* | The tables for which changes are to be captured | null | MEDIUM
| *camel.component.debezium-postgres.timePrecision Mode* | Time, date, and timestamps can be represented with different kinds of precisions, including:'adaptive' (the default) bases the precision of time, date, and timestamp values on the database column's precision; 'adaptive_time_microseconds' like 'adaptive' mode, but TIME fields always use microseconds precision;'connect' always represents time, date, and timestamp values using Kafka Connect's built-in representations for Time, Date, and Timestamp, which uses millisecond precision regardless of the database columns' precision . | "adaptive" | MEDIUM
| *camel.component.debezium-postgres.toastedValue Placeholder* | Specify the constant that will be provided by Debezium to indicate that the original value is a toasted value not provided by the database.If starts with 'hex:' prefix it is expected that the rest of the string repesents hexadecimally encoded octets. | "__debezium_unavailable_value" | MEDIUM
| *camel.component.debezium-postgres.tombstonesOn Delete* | Whether delete operations should be represented by a delete event and a subsquenttombstone event (true) or only by a delete event (false). Emitting the tombstone event (the default behavior) allows Kafka to completely delete all events pertaining to the given key once the source record got deleted. | false | MEDIUM
| *camel.component.debezium-postgres.xminFetch IntervalMs* | Specify how often (in ms) the xmin will be fetched from the replication slot. This xmin value is exposed by the slot which gives a lower bound of where a new replication slot could start from. The lower the value, the more likely this value is to be the current 'true' value, but the bigger the performance cost. The bigger the value, the less likely this value is to be the current 'true' value, but the lower the performance penalty. The default is set to 0 ms, which disables tracking xmin. | 0L | MEDIUM
