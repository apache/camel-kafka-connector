This approach should be avoided when accessing a remote file system via a mount\/share unless that file system supports distributed file locks. - rename - rename is for using a try to rename the file as a test if we can get exclusive read-lock. - idempotent - (only for file component) idempotent is for using a idempotentRepository as the read-lock.

This allows to use read locks that supports clustering if the idempotent repository implementation supports that. - idempotent-rename - (only for file component) idempotent-rename is for using a idempotentRepository and rename as the combined read-lock. This allows to use read locks that supports clustering if the idempotent repository implementation supports that.Notice: The various read locks is not all suited to work in clustered mode, where concurrent consumers on different nodes is competing for the same files on a shared file system. The markerFile using a close to atomic operation to create the empty marker file, but its not guaranteed to work in a cluster. The fileLock may work better but then the file system need to support distributed file locks, and so on. Using the idempotent read lock can support clustering if the idempotent repository supports clustering, such as Hazelcast Component or Infinispan.
