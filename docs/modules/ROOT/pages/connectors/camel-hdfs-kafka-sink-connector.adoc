[[camel-hdfs-kafka-connector-sink]]
= camel-hdfs-kafka-connector sink configuration

When using camel-hdfs-kafka-connector as sink make sure to use the following Maven dependency to have support for the connector:

[source,xml]
----
<dependency>
  <groupId>org.apache.camel.kafkaconnector</groupId>
  <artifactId>camel-hdfs-kafka-connector</artifactId>
  <version>x.x.x</version>
  <!-- use the same version as your Camel Kafka connector version -->
</dependency>
----

To use this Sink connector in Kafka connect you'll need to set the following connector.class

[source,java]
----
connector.class=org.apache.camel.kafkaconnector.hdfs.CamelHdfsSinkConnector
----


The camel-hdfs sink connector supports 32 options, which are listed below.



[width="100%",cols="2,5,^1,2",options="header"]
|===
| Name | Description | Default | Priority
| *camel.sink.path.hostName* | HDFS host to use | null | HIGH
| *camel.sink.path.port* | HDFS port to use | 8020 | MEDIUM
| *camel.sink.path.path* | The directory path to use | null | HIGH
| *camel.sink.endpoint.connectOnStartup* | Whether to connect to the HDFS file system on starting the producer/consumer. If false then the connection is created on-demand. Notice that HDFS may take up till 15 minutes to establish a connection, as it has hardcoded 45 x 20 sec redelivery. By setting this option to false allows your application to startup, and not block for up till 15 minutes. | true | MEDIUM
| *camel.sink.endpoint.fileSystemType* | Set to LOCAL to not use HDFS but local java.io.File instead. One of: [LOCAL] [HDFS] | "HDFS" | MEDIUM
| *camel.sink.endpoint.fileType* | The file type to use. For more details see Hadoop HDFS documentation about the various files types. One of: [NORMAL_FILE] [SEQUENCE_FILE] [MAP_FILE] [BLOOMMAP_FILE] [ARRAY_FILE] | "NORMAL_FILE" | MEDIUM
| *camel.sink.endpoint.keyType* | The type for the key in case of sequence or map files. One of: [NULL] [BOOLEAN] [BYTE] [INT] [FLOAT] [LONG] [DOUBLE] [TEXT] [BYTES] | "NULL" | MEDIUM
| *camel.sink.endpoint.namedNodes* | A comma separated list of named nodes (e.g. srv11.example.com:8020,srv12.example.com:8020) | null | MEDIUM
| *camel.sink.endpoint.owner* | The file owner must match this owner for the consumer to pickup the file. Otherwise the file is skipped. | null | MEDIUM
| *camel.sink.endpoint.valueType* | The type for the key in case of sequence or map files One of: [NULL] [BOOLEAN] [BYTE] [INT] [FLOAT] [LONG] [DOUBLE] [TEXT] [BYTES] | "BYTES" | MEDIUM
| *camel.sink.endpoint.append* | Append to existing file. Notice that not all HDFS file systems support the append option. | false | MEDIUM
| *camel.sink.endpoint.lazyStartProducer* | Whether the producer should be started lazy (on the first message). By starting lazy you can use this to allow CamelContext and routes to startup in situations where a producer may otherwise fail during starting and cause the route to fail being started. By deferring this startup to be lazy then the startup failure can be handled during routing messages via Camel's routing error handlers. Beware that when the first message is processed then creating and starting the producer may take a little time and prolong the total processing time of the processing. | false | MEDIUM
| *camel.sink.endpoint.overwrite* | Whether to overwrite existing files with the same name | true | MEDIUM
| *camel.sink.endpoint.basicPropertyBinding* | Whether the endpoint should use basic property binding (Camel 2.x) or the newer property binding with additional capabilities | false | MEDIUM
| *camel.sink.endpoint.blockSize* | The size of the HDFS blocks | 67108864L | MEDIUM
| *camel.sink.endpoint.bufferSize* | The buffer size used by HDFS | 4096 | MEDIUM
| *camel.sink.endpoint.checkIdleInterval* | How often (time in millis) in to run the idle checker background task. This option is only in use if the splitter strategy is IDLE. | 500 | MEDIUM
| *camel.sink.endpoint.chunkSize* | When reading a normal file, this is split into chunks producing a message per chunk. | 4096 | MEDIUM
| *camel.sink.endpoint.compressionCodec* | The compression codec to use One of: [DEFAULT] [GZIP] [BZIP2] | "DEFAULT" | MEDIUM
| *camel.sink.endpoint.compressionType* | The compression type to use (is default not in use) One of: [NONE] [RECORD] [BLOCK] | "NONE" | MEDIUM
| *camel.sink.endpoint.openedSuffix* | When a file is opened for reading/writing the file is renamed with this suffix to avoid to read it during the writing phase. | "opened" | MEDIUM
| *camel.sink.endpoint.readSuffix* | Once the file has been read is renamed with this suffix to avoid to read it again. | "read" | MEDIUM
| *camel.sink.endpoint.replication* | The HDFS replication factor | 3 | MEDIUM
| *camel.sink.endpoint.splitStrategy* | In the current version of Hadoop opening a file in append mode is disabled since it's not very reliable. So, for the moment, it's only possible to create new files. The Camel HDFS endpoint tries to solve this problem in this way: If the split strategy option has been defined, the hdfs path will be used as a directory and files will be created using the configured UuidGenerator. Every time a splitting condition is met, a new file is created. The splitStrategy option is defined as a string with the following syntax: splitStrategy=ST:value,ST:value,... where ST can be: BYTES a new file is created, and the old is closed when the number of written bytes is more than value MESSAGES a new file is created, and the old is closed when the number of written messages is more than value IDLE a new file is created, and the old is closed when no writing happened in the last value milliseconds | null | MEDIUM
| *camel.sink.endpoint.synchronous* | Sets whether synchronous processing should be strictly used, or Camel is allowed to use asynchronous processing (if supported). | false | MEDIUM
| *camel.sink.endpoint.kerberosConfigFileLocation* | The location of the kerb5.conf file (\https://web.mit.edu/kerberos/krb5-1.12/doc/admin/conf_files/krb5_conf.html) | null | MEDIUM
| *camel.sink.endpoint.kerberosKeytabLocation* | The location of the keytab file used to authenticate with the kerberos nodes (contains pairs of kerberos principals and encrypted keys (which are derived from the Kerberos password)) | null | MEDIUM
| *camel.sink.endpoint.kerberosUsername* | The username used to authenticate with the kerberos nodes | null | MEDIUM
| *camel.component.hdfs.lazyStartProducer* | Whether the producer should be started lazy (on the first message). By starting lazy you can use this to allow CamelContext and routes to startup in situations where a producer may otherwise fail during starting and cause the route to fail being started. By deferring this startup to be lazy then the startup failure can be handled during routing messages via Camel's routing error handlers. Beware that when the first message is processed then creating and starting the producer may take a little time and prolong the total processing time of the processing. | false | MEDIUM
| *camel.component.hdfs.basicPropertyBinding* | Whether the component should use basic property binding (Camel 2.x) or the newer property binding with additional capabilities | false | LOW
| *camel.component.hdfs.jAASConfiguration* | To use the given configuration for security with JAAS. | null | MEDIUM
| *camel.component.hdfs.kerberosConfigFile* | To use kerberos authentication, set the value of the 'java.security.krb5.conf' environment variable to an existing file. If the environment variable is already set, warn if different than the specified parameter | null | MEDIUM
