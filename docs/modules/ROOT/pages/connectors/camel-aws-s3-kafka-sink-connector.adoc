Connector Description: Store and retrieve objects from AWS S3 Storage Service.

When using camel-aws-s3-kafka-connector as sink make sure to use the following Maven dependency to have support for the connector:

[source,xml]
----
<dependency>
  <groupId>org.apache.camel.kafkaconnector</groupId>
  <artifactId>camel-aws-s3-kafka-connector</artifactId>
  <version>x.x.x</version>
  <!-- use the same version as your Camel Kafka connector version -->
</dependency>
----

To use this Sink connector in Kafka connect you'll need to set the following connector.class

[source,java]
----
connector.class=org.apache.camel.kafkaconnector.awss3.CamelAwss3SinkConnector
----

| *camel.sink.endpoint.autoCreateBucket* | Setting the autocreation of the bucket | true | false | MEDIUM
| *camel.sink.endpoint.autoDiscoverClient* | Setting the autoDiscoverClient mechanism, if true, the component will look for a client instance in the registry automatically otherwise it will skip that checking. | true | false | MEDIUM
| *camel.sink.endpoint.endpointConfiguration* | Amazon AWS Endpoint Configuration | null | false | MEDIUM
| *camel.sink.endpoint.pathStyleAccess* | Whether or not the S3 client should use path style access | false | false | MEDIUM

| *camel.sink.endpoint.region* | The region in which S3 client needs to work. When using this parameter, the configuration will expect the capitalized name of the region (for example AP_EAST_1) You'll need to use the name Regions.EU_WEST_1.name() | null | false | MEDIUM
| *camel.sink.endpoint.useIAMCredentials* | Set whether the S3 client should expect to load credentials on an EC2 instance or to expect static credentials to be passed in. | false | false | MEDIUM
