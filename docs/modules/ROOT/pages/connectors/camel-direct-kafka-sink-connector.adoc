Connector Description: Call another endpoint from the same Camel Context synchronously.

When using camel-direct-kafka-connector as sink make sure to use the following Maven dependency to have support for the connector:

[source,xml]
----
<dependency>
  <groupId>org.apache.camel.kafkaconnector</groupId>
  <artifactId>camel-direct-kafka-connector</artifactId>
  <version>x.x.x</version>
  <!-- use the same version as your Camel Kafka connector version -->
</dependency>
----

To use this Sink connector in Kafka connect you'll need to set the following connector.class

[source,java]
----
connector.class=org.apache.camel.kafkaconnector.direct.CamelDirectSinkConnector
----


The camel-direct sink connector supports 10 options, which are listed below.



[width="100%",cols="2,5,^1,1,1",options="header"]
|===
| Name | Description | Default | Required | Priority
| *camel.sink.path.name* | Name of direct endpoint | null | true | HIGH
| *camel.sink.endpoint.block* | If sending a message to a direct endpoint which has no active consumer, then we can tell the producer to block and wait for the consumer to become active. | true | false | MEDIUM
| *camel.sink.endpoint.failIfNoConsumers* | Whether the producer should fail by throwing an exception, when sending to a DIRECT endpoint with no active consumers. | true | false | MEDIUM
| *camel.sink.endpoint.lazyStartProducer* | Whether the producer should be started lazy (on the first message). By starting lazy you can use this to allow CamelContext and routes to startup in situations where a producer may otherwise fail during starting and cause the route to fail being started. By deferring this startup to be lazy then the startup failure can be handled during routing messages via Camel's routing error handlers. Beware that when the first message is processed then creating and starting the producer may take a little time and prolong the total processing time of the processing. | false | false | MEDIUM
| *camel.sink.endpoint.timeout* | The timeout value to use if block is enabled. | 30000L | false | MEDIUM
| *camel.sink.endpoint.synchronous* | Whether synchronous processing is forced. If enabled then the producer thread, will be forced to wait until the message has been completed before the same thread will continue processing. If disabled (default) then the producer thread may be freed and can do other work while the message is continued processed by other threads (reactive). | false | false | MEDIUM
| *camel.component.direct.block* | If sending a message to a direct endpoint which has no active consumer, then we can tell the producer to block and wait for the consumer to become active. | true | false | MEDIUM
| *camel.component.direct.lazyStartProducer* | Whether the producer should be started lazy (on the first message). By starting lazy you can use this to allow CamelContext and routes to startup in situations where a producer may otherwise fail during starting and cause the route to fail being started. By deferring this startup to be lazy then the startup failure can be handled during routing messages via Camel's routing error handlers. Beware that when the first message is processed then creating and starting the producer may take a little time and prolong the total processing time of the processing. | false | false | MEDIUM
| *camel.component.direct.timeout* | The timeout value to use if block is enabled. | 30000L | false | MEDIUM
| *camel.component.direct.autowiredEnabled* | Whether autowiring is enabled. This is used for automatic autowiring options (the option must be marked as autowired) by looking up in the registry to find if there is a single instance of matching type, which then gets configured on the component. This can be used for automatic configuring JDBC data sources, JMS connection factories, AWS Clients, etc. | true | false | MEDIUM
