= camel-hazelcast-map-kafka-connector source configuration

When using camel-hazelcast-map-kafka-connector as source make sure to use the following Maven dependency to have support for the connector:

[source,xml]
----
<dependency>
  <groupId>org.apache.camel.kafkaconnector</groupId>
  <artifactId>camel-hazelcast-map-kafka-connector</artifactId>
  <version>x.x.x</version>
  <!-- use the same version as your Camel Kafka connector version -->
</dependency>
----

To use this Source connector in Kafka connect you'll need to set the following connector.class

[source,java]
----
connector.class=org.apache.camel.kafkaconnector.hazelcastmap.CamelHazelcastmapSourceConnector
----


The camel-hazelcast-map source connector supports 13 options, which are listed below.

|===
| Name | Description | Default | Priority
| *camel.source.path.cacheName* | The name of the cache | null | HIGH
| *camel.source.endpoint.defaultOperation* | To specify a default operation to use, if no operation header has been provided. One of: [put] [delete] [get] [update] [query] [getAll] [clear] [putIfAbsent] [allAll] [removeAll] [retainAll] [evict] [evictAll] [valueCount] [containsKey] [containsValue] [keySet] [removevalue] [increment] [decrement] [setvalue] [destroy] [compareAndSet] [getAndAdd] [add] [offer] [peek] [poll] [remainingCapacity] [drainTo] [removeIf] [take] [publish] [readOnceHeal] [readOnceTail] [capacity] | null | MEDIUM
| *camel.source.endpoint.hazelcastInstance* | The hazelcast instance reference which can be used for hazelcast endpoint. | null | MEDIUM
| *camel.source.endpoint.hazelcastInstanceName* | The hazelcast instance reference name which can be used for hazelcast endpoint. If you don't specify the instance reference, camel use the default hazelcast instance from the camel-hazelcast instance. | null | MEDIUM
| *camel.source.endpoint.bridgeErrorHandler* | Allows for bridging the consumer to the Camel routing Error Handler, which mean any exceptions occurred while the consumer is trying to pickup incoming messages, or the likes, will now be processed as a message and handled by the routing Error Handler. By default the consumer will use the org.apache.camel.spi.ExceptionHandler to deal with exceptions, that will be logged at WARN or ERROR level and ignored. | false | MEDIUM
| *camel.source.endpoint.exceptionHandler* | To let the consumer use a custom ExceptionHandler. Notice if the option bridgeErrorHandler is enabled then this option is not in use. By default the consumer will deal with exceptions, that will be logged at WARN or ERROR level and ignored. | null | MEDIUM
| *camel.source.endpoint.exchangePattern* | Sets the exchange pattern when the consumer creates an exchange. One of: [InOnly] [InOut] [InOptionalOut] | null | MEDIUM
| *camel.source.endpoint.basicPropertyBinding* | Whether the endpoint should use basic property binding (Camel 2.x) or the newer property binding with additional capabilities | false | MEDIUM
| *camel.source.endpoint.synchronous* | Sets whether synchronous processing should be strictly used, or Camel is allowed to use asynchronous processing (if supported). | false | MEDIUM
| *camel.component.hazelcast-map.bridgeErrorHandler* | Allows for bridging the consumer to the Camel routing Error Handler, which mean any exceptions occurred while the consumer is trying to pickup incoming messages, or the likes, will now be processed as a message and handled by the routing Error Handler. By default the consumer will use the org.apache.camel.spi.ExceptionHandler to deal with exceptions, that will be logged at WARN or ERROR level and ignored. | false | MEDIUM
| *camel.component.hazelcast-map.basicPropertyBinding* | Whether the component should use basic property binding (Camel 2.x) or the newer property binding with additional capabilities | false | LOW
| *camel.component.hazelcast-map.hazelcastInstance* | The hazelcast instance reference which can be used for hazelcast endpoint. If you don't specify the instance reference, camel use the default hazelcast instance from the camel-hazelcast instance. | null | MEDIUM
| *camel.component.hazelcast-map.hazelcastMode* | The hazelcast mode reference which kind of instance should be used. If you don't specify the mode, then the node mode will be the default. | "node" | MEDIUM
