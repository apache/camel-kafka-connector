[width="100%",cols="2,5,^1,2",options="header"]
|===
| Name | Description | Default | Priority
| *camel.source.path.resourceUri* | Path to the resource. You can prefix with: classpath, file, http, ref, or bean. classpath, file and http loads the resource using these protocols (classpath is default). ref will lookup the resource in the registry. bean will call a method on a bean to be used as the resource. For bean you can specify the method name after dot, eg bean:myBean.myMethod. | null | HIGH
| *camel.source.endpoint.allowContextMapAll* | Sets whether the context map should allow access to all details. By default only the message body and headers can be accessed.

| *camel.source.endpoint.allowTemplateFromHeader* | Whether to allow to use resource template from header or not (default false). Enabling this allows to specify dynamic templates via message header.
