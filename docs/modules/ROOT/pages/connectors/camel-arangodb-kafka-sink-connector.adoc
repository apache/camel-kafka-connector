= camel-arangodb-kafka-connector sink configuration

When using camel-arangodb-kafka-connector as sink make sure to use the following Maven dependency to have support for the connector:

[source,xml]
----
<dependency>
  <groupId>org.apache.camel.kafkaconnector</groupId>
  <artifactId>camel-arangodb-kafka-connector</artifactId>
  <version>x.x.x</version>
  <!-- use the same version as your Camel Kafka connector version -->
</dependency>
----

To use this Sink connector in Kafka connect you'll need to set the following connector.class

[source,java]
----
connector.class=org.apache.camel.kafkaconnector.arangodb.CamelArangodbSinkConnector
----


The camel-arangodb sink connector supports 25 options, which are listed below.

|===
| Name | Description | Default | Priority
| *camel.sink.path.database* | database name | null | HIGH
| *camel.sink.endpoint.documentCollection* | Collection name, when using ArangoDb as a Document Database. Set the documentCollection name when using the CRUD operation on the document database collections (SAVE_DOCUMENT , FIND_DOCUMENT_BY_KEY, UPDATE_DOCUMENT, DELETE_DOCUMENT). | null | MEDIUM
| *camel.sink.endpoint.edgeCollection* | Collection name of vertices, when using ArangoDb as a Graph Database. Set the edgeCollection name to perform CRUD operation on edges using these operations : SAVE_VERTEX, FIND_VERTEX_BY_KEY, UPDATE_VERTEX, DELETE_VERTEX. The graph attribute is mandatory. | null | MEDIUM
| *camel.sink.endpoint.graph* | Graph name, when using ArangoDb as a Graph Database. Combine this attribute with one of the two attributes vertexCollection and edgeCollection. | null | MEDIUM
| *camel.sink.endpoint.host* | ArangoDB host. If host and port are default, this field is Optional. | null | MEDIUM
| *camel.sink.endpoint.lazyStartProducer* | Whether the producer should be started lazy (on the first message). By starting lazy you can use this to allow CamelContext and routes to startup in situations where a producer may otherwise fail during starting and cause the route to fail being started. By deferring this startup to be lazy then the startup failure can be handled during routing messages via Camel's routing error handlers. Beware that when the first message is processed then creating and starting the producer may take a little time and prolong the total processing time of the processing. | false | MEDIUM
| *camel.sink.endpoint.operation* | Operations to perform on ArangoDb. For the operation AQL_QUERY, no need to specify a collection or graph. One of: [SAVE_DOCUMENT] [FIND_DOCUMENT_BY_KEY] [UPDATE_DOCUMENT] [DELETE_DOCUMENT] [AQL_QUERY] [SAVE_VERTEX] [FIND_VERTEX_BY_KEY] [UPDATE_VERTEX] [DELETE_VERTEX] [SAVE_EDGE] [FIND_EDGE_BY_KEY] [UPDATE_EDGE] [DELETE_EDGE] | null | MEDIUM
| *camel.sink.endpoint.port* | ArangoDB exposed port. If host and port are default, this field is Optional. | null | MEDIUM
| *camel.sink.endpoint.vertexCollection* | Collection name of vertices, when using ArangoDb as a Graph Database. Set the vertexCollection name to perform CRUD operation on vertices using these operations : SAVE_EDGE, FIND_EDGE_BY_KEY, UPDATE_EDGE, DELETE_EDGE. The graph attribute is mandatory. | null | MEDIUM
| *camel.sink.endpoint.basicPropertyBinding* | Whether the endpoint should use basic property binding (Camel 2.x) or the newer property binding with additional capabilities | false | MEDIUM
| *camel.sink.endpoint.synchronous* | Sets whether synchronous processing should be strictly used, or Camel is allowed to use asynchronous processing (if supported). | false | MEDIUM
| *camel.sink.endpoint.password* | ArangoDB password. If user and password are default, this field is Optional. | null | MEDIUM
| *camel.sink.endpoint.user* | ArangoDB user. If user and password are default, this field is Optional. | null | MEDIUM
| *camel.component.arangodb.configuration* | Component configuration | null | MEDIUM
| *camel.component.arangodb.documentCollection* | Collection name, when using ArangoDb as a Document Database. Set the documentCollection name when using the CRUD operation on the document database collections (SAVE_DOCUMENT , FIND_DOCUMENT_BY_KEY, UPDATE_DOCUMENT, DELETE_DOCUMENT). | null | MEDIUM
| *camel.component.arangodb.edgeCollection* | Collection name of vertices, when using ArangoDb as a Graph Database. Set the edgeCollection name to perform CRUD operation on edges using these operations : SAVE_VERTEX, FIND_VERTEX_BY_KEY, UPDATE_VERTEX, DELETE_VERTEX. The graph attribute is mandatory. | null | MEDIUM
| *camel.component.arangodb.graph* | Graph name, when using ArangoDb as a Graph Database. Combine this attribute with one of the two attributes vertexCollection and edgeCollection. | null | MEDIUM
| *camel.component.arangodb.host* | ArangoDB host. If host and port are default, this field is Optional. | null | MEDIUM

By starting lazy you can use this to allow CamelContext and routes to startup in situations where a producer may otherwise fail during starting and cause the route to fail being started. By deferring this startup to be lazy then the startup failure can be handled during routing messages via Camel's routing error handlers.

One of: [SAVE_DOCUMENT] [FIND_DOCUMENT_BY_KEY] [UPDATE_DOCUMENT] [DELETE_DOCUMENT] [AQL_QUERY] [SAVE_VERTEX] [FIND_VERTEX_BY_KEY] [UPDATE_VERTEX] [DELETE_VERTEX] [SAVE_EDGE] [FIND_EDGE_BY_KEY] [UPDATE_EDGE] [DELETE_EDGE] | null | MEDIUM
| *camel.component.arangodb.port* | ArangoDB exposed port. If host and port are default, this field is Optional. | null | MEDIUM
| *camel.component.arangodb.vertexCollection* | Collection name of vertices, when using ArangoDb as a Graph Database. Set the vertexCollection name to perform CRUD operation on vertices using these operations : SAVE_EDGE, FIND_EDGE_BY_KEY, UPDATE_EDGE, DELETE_EDGE. The graph attribute is mandatory. | null | MEDIUM
| *camel.component.arangodb.basicPropertyBinding* | Whether the component should use basic property binding (Camel 2.x) or the newer property binding with additional capabilities | false | LOW
