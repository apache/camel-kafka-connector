When using camel-beanstalk-kafka-connector as sink make sure to use the following Maven dependency to have support for the connector:

[source,xml]
----
<dependency>
  <groupId>org.apache.camel.kafkaconnector</groupId>
  <artifactId>camel-beanstalk-kafka-connector</artifactId>
  <version>x.x.x</version>
  <!-- use the same version as your Camel Kafka connector version -->
</dependency>
----

To use this Sink connector in Kafka connect you'll need to set the following connector.class

[source,java]

[width="100%",cols="2,5,^1,2",options="header"]
|===
| Name | Description | Default | Priority
| *camel.sink.path.connectionSettings* | Connection settings host:port/tube | null | MEDIUM
| *camel.sink.endpoint.command* | put means to put the job into Beanstalk. Job body is specified in the Camel message body. Job ID will be returned in beanstalk.jobId message header. delete, release, touch or bury expect Job ID in the message header beanstalk.jobId. Result of the operation is returned in beanstalk.result message header kick expects the number of jobs to kick in the message body and returns the number of jobs actually kicked out in the message header beanstalk.result. One of: [bury] [release] [put] [touch] [delete] [kick] | null | MEDIUM
| *camel.sink.endpoint.jobDelay* | Job delay in seconds. | 0 | MEDIUM
| *camel.sink.endpoint.jobPriority* | Job priority. (0 is the highest, see Beanstalk protocol) | 1000L | MEDIUM
| *camel.sink.endpoint.jobTimeToRun* | Job time to run in seconds. (when 0, the beanstalkd daemon raises it to 1 automatically, see Beanstalk protocol) | 60 | MEDIUM
| *camel.sink.endpoint.lazyStartProducer* | Whether the producer should be started lazy (on the first message). By starting lazy you can use this to allow CamelContext and routes to startup in situations where a producer may otherwise fail during starting and cause the route to fail being started. By deferring this startup to be lazy then the startup failure can be handled during routing messages via Camel's routing error handlers. Beware that when the first message is processed then creating and starting the producer may take a little time and prolong the total processing time of the processing. | false | MEDIUM
| *camel.sink.endpoint.basicPropertyBinding* | Whether the endpoint should use basic property binding (Camel 2.x) or the newer property binding with additional capabilities | false | MEDIUM
| *camel.sink.endpoint.synchronous* | Sets whether synchronous processing should be strictly used, or Camel is allowed to use asynchronous processing (if supported). | false | MEDIUM
| *camel.component.beanstalk.lazyStartProducer* | Whether the producer should be started lazy (on the first message). By starting lazy you can use this to allow CamelContext and routes to startup in situations where a producer may otherwise fail during starting and cause the route to fail being started. By deferring this startup to be lazy then the startup failure can be handled during routing messages via Camel's routing error handlers. Beware that when the first message is processed then creating and starting the producer may take a little time and prolong the total processing time of the processing. | false | MEDIUM
| *camel.component.beanstalk.basicPropertyBinding* | Whether the component should use basic property binding (Camel 2.x) or the newer property binding with additional capabilities | false | LOW
| *camel.component.beanstalk.connectionSettings Factory* | Custom ConnectionSettingsFactory. Specify which ConnectionSettingsFactory to use to make connections to Beanstalkd. Especially useful for unit testing without beanstalkd daemon (you can mock ConnectionSettings) | null | MEDIUM
