Connector description: Send and receive messages from RabbitMQ using Spring RabbitMQ client.

When using camel-spring-rabbitmq-kafka-connector as source make sure to use the following Maven dependency to have support for the connector:

[source,xml]
----
<dependency>
  <groupId>org.apache.camel.kafkaconnector</groupId>
  <artifactId>camel-spring-rabbitmq-kafka-connector</artifactId>
  <version>x.x.x</version>
  <!-- use the same version as your Camel Kafka connector version -->
</dependency>
----

To use this Source connector in Kafka connect you'll need to set the following connector.class

[source,java]

----


The camel-spring-rabbitmq source connector supports 58 options, which are listed below.



[width="100%",cols="2,5,^1,1,1",options="header"]
|===
| Name | Description | Default | Required | Priority
| *camel.source.path.exchangeName* | The exchange name determines the exchange to which the produced messages will be sent to. In the case of consumers, the exchange name determines the exchange the queue will be bound to. Note: to use default exchange then do not use empty name, but use default instead. | null | true | HIGH
| *camel.source.endpoint.connectionFactory* | The connection factory to be use. A connection factory must be configured either on the component or endpoint. | null | false | MEDIUM
| *camel.source.endpoint.disableReplyTo* | Specifies whether Camel ignores the ReplyTo header in messages. If true, Camel does not send a reply back to the destination specified in the ReplyTo header. You can use this option if you want Camel to consume from a route and you do not want Camel to automatically send back a reply message because another component in your code handles the reply message. You can also use this option if you want to use Camel as a proxy between different message brokers and you want to route message from one system to another. | false | false | MEDIUM
| *camel.source.endpoint.routingKey* | The value of a routing key to use. Default is empty which is not helpful when using the default (or any direct) exchange, but fine if the exchange is a headers exchange for instance. | null | false | MEDIUM
| *camel.source.endpoint.testConnectionOnStartup* | Specifies whether to test the connection on startup. This ensures that when Camel starts that all the JMS consumers have a valid connection to the JMS broker. If a connection cannot be granted then Camel throws an exception on startup. This ensures that Camel is not started with failed connections. The JMS producers is tested as well. | false | false | MEDIUM
| *camel.source.endpoint.acknowledgeMode* | Flag controlling the behaviour of the container with respect to message acknowledgement. The most common usage is to let the container handle the acknowledgements (so the listener doesn't need to know about the channel or the message). Set to AcknowledgeMode.MANUAL if the listener will send the acknowledgements itself using Channel.basicAck(long, boolean). Manual acks are consistent with either a transactional or non-transactional channel, but if you are doing no other work on the channel at the same other than receiving a single message then the transaction is probably unnecessary. Set to AcknowledgeMode.NONE to tell the broker not to expect any acknowledgements, and it will assume all messages are acknowledged as soon as they are sent (this is autoack in native Rabbit broker terms). If AcknowledgeMode.NONE then the channel cannot be transactional (so the container will fail on start up if that flag is accidentally set). One of: [NONE] [MANUAL] [AUTO] | null | false | MEDIUM
| *camel.source.endpoint.asyncConsumer* | Whether the consumer processes the Exchange asynchronously. If enabled then the consumer may pickup the next message from the queue, while the previous message is being processed asynchronously (by the Asynchronous Routing Engine). This means that messages may be processed not 100% strictly in order. If disabled (as default) then the Exchange is fully processed before the consumer will pickup the next message from the queue. | false | false | MEDIUM
| *camel.source.endpoint.autoDeclare* | Specifies whether the consumer should auto declare binding between exchange, queue and routing key when starting. | true | false | MEDIUM
| *camel.source.endpoint.autoStartup* | Specifies whether the consumer container should auto-startup. | true | false | MEDIUM
| *camel.source.endpoint.bridgeErrorHandler* | Allows for bridging the consumer to the Camel routing Error Handler, which mean any exceptions occurred while the consumer is trying to pickup incoming messages, or the likes, will now be processed as a message and handled by the routing Error Handler. By default the consumer will use the org.apache.camel.spi.ExceptionHandler to deal with exceptions, that will be logged at WARN or ERROR level and ignored. | false | false | MEDIUM
| *camel.source.endpoint.deadLetterExchange* | The name of the dead letter exchange | null | false | MEDIUM
| *camel.source.endpoint.deadLetterExchangeType* | The type of the dead letter exchange One of: [direct] [fanout] [headers] [topic] | "direct" | false | MEDIUM
| *camel.source.endpoint.deadLetterQueue* | The name of the dead letter queue | null | false | MEDIUM
| *camel.source.endpoint.deadLetterRoutingKey* | The routing key for the dead letter exchange | null | false | MEDIUM
| *camel.source.endpoint.exchangeType* | The type of the exchange One of: [direct] [fanout] [headers] [topic] | "direct" | false | MEDIUM
| *camel.source.endpoint.exclusive* | Set to true for an exclusive consumer | false | false | MEDIUM
| *camel.source.endpoint.maximumRetryAttempts* | How many times a Rabbitmq consumer will retry the same message if Camel failed to process the message | 5 | false | MEDIUM
| *camel.source.endpoint.noLocal* | Set to true for an no-local consumer | false | false | MEDIUM
| *camel.source.endpoint.queues* | The queue(s) to use for consuming messages. Multiple queue names can be separated by comma. If none has been configured then Camel will generate an unique id as the queue name for the consumer. | null | false | MEDIUM
| *camel.source.endpoint.rejectAndDontRequeue* | Whether a Rabbitmq consumer should reject the message without requeuing. This enables failed messages to be sent to a Dead Letter Exchange/Queue, if the broker is so configured. | true | false | MEDIUM
| *camel.source.endpoint.retryDelay* | Delay in msec a Rabbitmq consumer will wait before redelivering a message that Camel failed to process | 1000 | false | MEDIUM
| *camel.source.endpoint.concurrentConsumers* | The number of consumers | null | false | MEDIUM
| *camel.source.endpoint.exceptionHandler* | To let the consumer use a custom ExceptionHandler. Notice if the option bridgeErrorHandler is enabled then this option is not in use. By default the consumer will deal with exceptions, that will be logged at WARN or ERROR level and ignored. | null | false | MEDIUM
| *camel.source.endpoint.exchangePattern* | Sets the exchange pattern when the consumer creates an exchange. One of: [InOnly] [InOut] [InOptionalOut] | null | false | MEDIUM
| *camel.source.endpoint.maxConcurrentConsumers* | The maximum number of consumers (available only with SMLC) | null | false | MEDIUM

| *camel.source.endpoint.args* | Specify arguments for configuring the different RabbitMQ concepts, a different prefix is required for each element: arg.consumer. arg.exchange. arg.queue. arg.binding. arg.dlq.exchange. arg.dlq.queue. arg.dlq.binding. For example to declare a queue with message ttl argument: args=arg.queue.x-message-ttl=60000 | null | false | MEDIUM

| *camel.component.spring-rabbitmq.connectionFactory* | The connection factory to be use. A connection factory must be configured either on the component or endpoint. | null | false | MEDIUM
| *camel.component.spring-rabbitmq.testConnectionOn Startup* | Specifies whether to test the connection on startup.
