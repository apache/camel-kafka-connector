Connector Description: To call serverless functions on Huawei Cloud

When using camel-hwcloud-functiongraph-kafka-connector as sink make sure to use the following Maven dependency to have support for the connector:

[source,xml]
----
<dependency>
  <groupId>org.apache.camel.kafkaconnector</groupId>
  <artifactId>camel-hwcloud-functiongraph-kafka-connector</artifactId>
  <version>x.x.x</version>
  <!-- use the same version as your Camel Kafka connector version -->
</dependency>
----

To use this Sink connector in Kafka connect you'll need to set the following connector.class

[source,java]

[width="100%",cols="2,5,^1,1,1",options="header"]
|===
| Name | Description | Default | Required | Priority
| *camel.sink.path.operation* | Operation to be performed | null | true | HIGH
| *camel.sink.endpoint.endpoint* | FunctionGraph url. Carries higher precedence than region parameter based client initialization | null | false | MEDIUM
| *camel.sink.endpoint.functionName* | Name of the function to invoke | null | false | MEDIUM
| *camel.sink.endpoint.functionPackage* | Functions that can be logically grouped together | "default" | false | MEDIUM
| *camel.sink.endpoint.lazyStartProducer* | Whether the producer should be started lazy (on the first message). By starting lazy you can use this to allow CamelContext and routes to startup in situations where a producer may otherwise fail during starting and cause the route to fail being started. By deferring this startup to be lazy then the startup failure can be handled during routing messages via Camel's routing error handlers. Beware that when the first message is processed then creating and starting the producer may take a little time and prolong the total processing time of the processing. | false | false | MEDIUM
| *camel.sink.endpoint.projectId* | Cloud project ID | null | true | HIGH
| *camel.sink.endpoint.region* | FunctionGraph service region. This is lower precedence than endpoint based configuration | null | true | HIGH
| *camel.sink.endpoint.serviceKeys* | Configuration object for cloud service authentication | null | false | MEDIUM
| *camel.sink.endpoint.proxyHost* | Proxy server ip/hostname | null | false | MEDIUM
| *camel.sink.endpoint.proxyPassword* | Proxy authentication password | null | false | MEDIUM
| *camel.sink.endpoint.proxyPort* | Proxy server port | null | false | MEDIUM
| *camel.sink.endpoint.proxyUser* | Proxy authentication user | null | false | MEDIUM
| *camel.sink.endpoint.authenticationKey* | Authentication key for the cloud user | null | true | HIGH
| *camel.sink.endpoint.ignoreSslVerification* | Ignore SSL verification | false | false | MEDIUM
| *camel.sink.endpoint.secretKey* | Secret key for the cloud user | null | true | HIGH
| *camel.component.hwcloud-functiongraph.lazyStart Producer* | Whether the producer should be started lazy (on the first message). By starting lazy you can use this to allow CamelContext and routes to startup in situations where a producer may otherwise fail during starting and cause the route to fail being started. By deferring this startup to be lazy then the startup failure can be handled during routing messages via Camel's routing error handlers. Beware that when the first message is processed then creating and starting the producer may take a little time and prolong the total processing time of the processing. | false | false | MEDIUM
| *camel.component.hwcloud-functiongraph.autowired Enabled* | Whether autowiring is enabled. This is used for automatic autowiring options (the option must be marked as autowired) by looking up in the registry to find if there is a single instance of matching type, which then gets configured on the component. This can be used for automatic configuring JDBC data sources, JMS connection factories, AWS Clients, etc. | true | false | MEDIUM
