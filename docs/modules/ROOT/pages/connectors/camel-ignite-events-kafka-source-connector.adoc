|===
| Name | Description | Default | Priority
| *camel.source.path.endpointId* | The endpoint ID (not used). | null | MEDIUM
| *camel.source.endpoint.bridgeErrorHandler* | Allows for bridging the consumer to the Camel routing Error Handler, which mean any exceptions occurred while the consumer is trying to pickup incoming messages, or the likes, will now be processed as a message and handled by the routing Error Handler. By default the consumer will use the org.apache.camel.spi.ExceptionHandler to deal with exceptions, that will be logged at WARN or ERROR level and ignored. | false | MEDIUM
| *camel.source.endpoint.clusterGroupExpression* | The cluster group expression. | null | MEDIUM
| *camel.source.endpoint.events* | The event types to subscribe to as a comma-separated string of event constants as defined in EventType. For example: EVT_CACHE_ENTRY_CREATED,EVT_CACHE_OBJECT_REMOVED,EVT_IGFS_DIR_CREATED. | "EVTS_ALL" | MEDIUM
| *camel.source.endpoint.propagateIncomingBodyIfNo ReturnValue* | Sets whether to propagate the incoming body if the return type of the underlying Ignite operation is void. | true | MEDIUM
| *camel.source.endpoint.treatCollectionsAsCache Objects* | Sets whether to treat Collections as cache objects or as Collections of items to insert/update/compute, etc. | false | MEDIUM
| *camel.source.endpoint.exceptionHandler* | To let the consumer use a custom ExceptionHandler. Notice if the option bridgeErrorHandler is enabled then this option is not in use. By default the consumer will deal with exceptions, that will be logged at WARN or ERROR level and ignored. | null | MEDIUM
| *camel.source.endpoint.exchangePattern* | Sets the exchange pattern when the consumer creates an exchange. One of: [InOnly] [InOut] [InOptionalOut] | null | MEDIUM
| *camel.source.endpoint.basicPropertyBinding* | Whether the endpoint should use basic property binding (Camel 2.x) or the newer property binding with additional capabilities | false | MEDIUM
| *camel.source.endpoint.synchronous* | Sets whether synchronous processing should be strictly used, or Camel is allowed to use asynchronous processing (if supported). | false | MEDIUM
| *camel.component.ignite-events.bridgeErrorHandler* | Allows for bridging the consumer to the Camel routing Error Handler, which mean any exceptions occurred while the consumer is trying to pickup incoming messages, or the likes, will now be processed as a message and handled by the routing Error Handler. By default the consumer will use the org.apache.camel.spi.ExceptionHandler to deal with exceptions, that will be logged at WARN or ERROR level and ignored. | false | MEDIUM
| *camel.component.ignite-events.configuration Resource* | The resource from where to load the configuration. It can be a: URL, String or InputStream type. | null | MEDIUM
