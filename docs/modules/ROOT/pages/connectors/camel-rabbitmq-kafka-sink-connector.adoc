When using camel-rabbitmq-kafka-connector as sink make sure to use the following Maven dependency to have support for the connector:

[source,xml]
----
<dependency>
  <groupId>org.apache.camel.kafkaconnector</groupId>
  <artifactId>camel-rabbitmq-kafka-connector</artifactId>
  <version>x.x.x</version>

The camel-rabbitmq sink connector supports 97 options, which are listed below.



[width="100%",cols="2,5,^1,2",options="header"]
|===
| Name | Description | Default | Priority
| *camel.sink.path.exchangeName* | The exchange name determines the exchange to which the produced messages will be sent to. In the case of consumers, the exchange name determines the exchange the queue will be bound to. | null | HIGH
| *camel.sink.endpoint.addresses* | If this option is set, camel-rabbitmq will try to create connection based on the setting of option addresses. The addresses value is a string which looks like server1:12345, server2:12345 | null | MEDIUM
| *camel.sink.endpoint.autoDelete* | If it is true, the exchange will be deleted when it is no longer in use | true | MEDIUM
| *camel.sink.endpoint.automaticRecoveryEnabled* | Enables connection automatic recovery (uses connection implementation that performs automatic recovery when existing connection has failures) | "true" | MEDIUM
| *camel.sink.endpoint.connectionFactory* | To use a custom RabbitMQ connection factory. When this option is set, all connection options (connectionTimeout, requestedChannelMax...) set on URI are not used | null | MEDIUM
| *camel.sink.endpoint.deadLetterExchange* | The name of the dead letter exchange | null | MEDIUM
| *camel.sink.endpoint.deadLetterExchangeType* | The type of the dead letter exchange One of: [direct] [fanout] [headers] [topic] | "direct" | MEDIUM
| *camel.sink.endpoint.deadLetterQueue* | The name of the dead letter queue | null | MEDIUM
| *camel.sink.endpoint.deadLetterRoutingKey* | The routing key for the dead letter exchange | null | MEDIUM
| *camel.sink.endpoint.declare* | If the option is true, camel declare the exchange and queue name and bind them together. If the option is false, camel won't declare the exchange and queue name on the server. | true | MEDIUM
| *camel.sink.endpoint.durable* | If we are declaring a durable exchange (the exchange will survive a server restart) | true | MEDIUM
| *camel.sink.endpoint.exchangeType* | The exchange type such as direct or topic. One of: [direct] [fanout] [headers] [topic] | "direct" | MEDIUM
| *camel.sink.endpoint.exclusive* | Exclusive queues may only be accessed by the current connection, and are deleted when that connection closes. | false | MEDIUM
| *camel.sink.endpoint.hostname* | The hostname of the running rabbitmq instance or cluster. | null | MEDIUM
| *camel.sink.endpoint.passive* | Passive queues depend on the queue already to be available at RabbitMQ. | false | MEDIUM
| *camel.sink.endpoint.portNumber* | Port number for the host with the running rabbitmq instance or cluster. Default value is 5672. | null | MEDIUM
| *camel.sink.endpoint.queue* | The queue to receive messages from | null | MEDIUM
| *camel.sink.endpoint.routingKey* | The routing key to use when binding a consumer queue to the exchange. For producer routing keys, you set the header rabbitmq.ROUTING_KEY. | null | MEDIUM
| *camel.sink.endpoint.skipExchangeDeclare* | This can be used if we need to declare the queue but not the exchange | false | MEDIUM
| *camel.sink.endpoint.skipQueueBind* | If true the queue will not be bound to the exchange after declaring it | false | MEDIUM
| *camel.sink.endpoint.skipQueueDeclare* | If true the producer will not declare and bind a queue. This can be used for directing messages via an existing routing key. | false | MEDIUM
| *camel.sink.endpoint.vhost* | The vhost for the channel | "/" | MEDIUM
| *camel.sink.endpoint.allowCustomHeaders* | Allow pass custom values to header | false | MEDIUM
| *camel.sink.endpoint.allowNullHeaders* | Allow pass null values to header | false | MEDIUM
| *camel.sink.endpoint.bridgeEndpoint* | If the bridgeEndpoint is true, the producer will ignore the message header of rabbitmq.EXCHANGE_NAME and rabbitmq.ROUTING_KEY | false | MEDIUM
| *camel.sink.endpoint.channelPoolMaxSize* | Get maximum number of opened channel in pool | 10 | MEDIUM
| *camel.sink.endpoint.channelPoolMaxWait* | Set the maximum number of milliseconds to wait for a channel from the pool | 1000L | MEDIUM
| *camel.sink.endpoint.guaranteedDeliveries* | When true, an exception will be thrown when the message cannot be delivered (basic.return) and the message is marked as mandatory. PublisherAcknowledgement will also be activated in this case. See also publisher acknowledgements - When will messages be confirmed. | false | MEDIUM
| *camel.sink.endpoint.immediate* | This flag tells the server how to react if the message cannot be routed to a queue consumer immediately. If this flag is set, the server will return an undeliverable message with a Return method. If this flag is zero, the server will queue the message, but with no guarantee that it will ever be consumed. If the header is present rabbitmq.IMMEDIATE it will override this option. | false | MEDIUM
| *camel.sink.endpoint.lazyStartProducer* | Whether the producer should be started lazy (on the first message). By starting lazy you can use this to allow CamelContext and routes to startup in situations where a producer may otherwise fail during starting and cause the route to fail being started. By deferring this startup to be lazy then the startup failure can be handled during routing messages via Camel's routing error handlers. Beware that when the first message is processed then creating and starting the producer may take a little time and prolong the total processing time of the processing. | false | MEDIUM
| *camel.sink.endpoint.mandatory* | This flag tells the server how to react if the message cannot be routed to a queue. If this flag is set, the server will return an unroutable message with a Return method. If this flag is zero, the server silently drops the message. If the header is present rabbitmq.MANDATORY it will override this option. | false | MEDIUM
| *camel.sink.endpoint.publisherAcknowledgements* | When true, the message will be published with publisher acknowledgements turned on | false | MEDIUM

| *camel.sink.endpoint.args* | Specify arguments for configuring the different RabbitMQ concepts, a different prefix is required for each: Exchange: arg.exchange. Queue: arg.queue. Binding: arg.binding. For example to declare a queue with message ttl argument: \http://localhost:5672/exchange/queueargs=arg.queue.x-message-ttl=60000 | null | MEDIUM
| *camel.sink.endpoint.basicPropertyBinding* | Whether the endpoint should use basic property binding (Camel 2.x) or the newer property binding with additional capabilities | false | MEDIUM
| *camel.sink.endpoint.clientProperties* | Connection client properties (client info used in negotiating with the server) | null | MEDIUM
| *camel.sink.endpoint.connectionFactoryException Handler* | Custom rabbitmq ExceptionHandler for ConnectionFactory | null | MEDIUM

| *camel.sink.endpoint.transferException* | When true and an inOut Exchange failed on the consumer side send the caused Exception back in the response | false | MEDIUM
| *camel.sink.endpoint.allowMessageBodySerialization* | Whether to allow Java serialization of the message body or not. If this value is true, the message body will be serialized on the producer side using Java serialization, if no type converter can handle the message body. On the consumer side, it will deserialize the message body if this value is true and the message contains a CamelSerialize header. Setting this value to true may introduce a security vulnerability as it allows an attacker to attempt to deserialize to a gadget object which could result in a RCE or other security vulnerability. | false | MEDIUM
| *camel.sink.endpoint.password* | Password for authenticated access | "guest" | MEDIUM
| *camel.sink.endpoint.sslProtocol* | Enables SSL on connection, accepted value are true, TLS and 'SSLv3 | null | MEDIUM
