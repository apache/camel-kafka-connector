= camel-fhir-kafka-connector source configuration

When using camel-fhir-kafka-connector as source make sure to use the following Maven dependency to have support for the connector:

[source,xml]
----
<dependency>
  <groupId>org.apache.camel.kafkaconnector</groupId>
  <artifactId>camel-fhir-kafka-connector</artifactId>
  <version>x.x.x</version>
  <!-- use the same version as your Camel Kafka connector version -->
</dependency>
----

To use this Source connector in Kafka connect you'll need to set the following connector.class

[source,java]
----
connector.class=org.apache.camel.kafkaconnector.fhir.CamelFhirSourceConnector
----


The camel-fhir source connector supports 73 options, which are listed below.

| *camel.source.endpoint.encoding* | Encoding to use for all request One of: [JSON] [XML] | null | MEDIUM
| *camel.source.endpoint.fhirVersion* | The FHIR Version to use One of: [DSTU2] [DSTU2_HL7ORG] [DSTU2_1] [DSTU3] [R4] [R5] | "R4" | MEDIUM

| *camel.source.endpoint.prettyPrint* | Pretty print all request | false | MEDIUM
| *camel.source.endpoint.serverUrl* | The FHIR server base URL | null | MEDIUM
| *camel.source.endpoint.bridgeErrorHandler* | Allows for bridging the consumer to the Camel routing Error Handler, which mean any exceptions occurred while the consumer is trying to pickup incoming messages, or the likes, will now be processed as a message and handled by the routing Error Handler. By default the consumer will use the org.apache.camel.spi.ExceptionHandler to deal with exceptions, that will be logged at WARN or ERROR level and ignored. | false | MEDIUM

| *camel.source.endpoint.exceptionHandler* | To let the consumer use a custom ExceptionHandler. Notice if the option bridgeErrorHandler is enabled then this option is not in use. By default the consumer will deal with exceptions, that will be logged at WARN or ERROR level and ignored. | null | MEDIUM
| *camel.source.endpoint.exchangePattern* | Sets the exchange pattern when the consumer creates an exchange. One of: [InOnly] [InOut] [InOptionalOut] | null | MEDIUM

| *camel.source.endpoint.fhirContext* | FhirContext is an expensive object to create. To avoid creating multiple instances, it can be set directly. | null | MEDIUM
| *camel.source.endpoint.forceConformanceCheck* | Force conformance check | false | MEDIUM
| *camel.source.endpoint.sessionCookie* | HTTP session cookie to add to every request | null | MEDIUM
| *camel.source.endpoint.socketTimeout* | How long to block for individual read/write operations (in ms) | "10000" | MEDIUM

| *camel.source.endpoint.backoffMultiplier* | To let the scheduled polling consumer backoff if there has been a number of subsequent idles/errors in a row. The multiplier is then the number of polls that will be skipped before the next actual attempt is happening again. When this option is in use then backoffIdleThreshold and/or backoffErrorThreshold must also be configured. | null | MEDIUM
| *camel.source.endpoint.delay* | Milliseconds before the next poll. | 500L | MEDIUM
