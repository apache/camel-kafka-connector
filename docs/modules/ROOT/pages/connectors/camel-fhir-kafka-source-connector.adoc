= camel-fhir-kafka-connector source configuration

When using camel-fhir-kafka-connector as source make sure to use the following Maven dependency to have support for the connector:

[source,xml]
----
<dependency>
  <groupId>org.apache.camel.kafkaconnector</groupId>
  <artifactId>camel-fhir-kafka-connector</artifactId>
  <version>x.x.x</version>
  <!-- use the same version as your Camel Kafka connector version -->
</dependency>

| *camel.source.endpoint.encoding* | Encoding to use for all request One of: [JSON] [XML] | null | MEDIUM
| *camel.source.endpoint.fhirVersion* | The FHIR Version to use One of: [DSTU2] [DSTU2_HL7ORG] [DSTU2_1] [DSTU3] [R4] [R5] | "R4" | MEDIUM

| *camel.source.endpoint.prettyPrint* | Pretty print all request | false | MEDIUM
| *camel.source.endpoint.serverUrl* | The FHIR server base URL | null | MEDIUM
| *camel.source.endpoint.bridgeErrorHandler* | Allows for bridging the consumer to the Camel routing Error Handler, which mean any exceptions occurred while the consumer is trying to pickup incoming messages, or the likes, will now be processed as a message and handled by the routing Error Handler. By default the consumer will use the org.apache.camel.spi.ExceptionHandler to deal with exceptions, that will be logged at WARN or ERROR level and ignored. | false | MEDIUM
| *camel.source.endpoint.sendEmptyMessageWhenIdle* | If the polling consumer did not poll any files, you can enable this option to send an empty message (no body) instead. | false | MEDIUM
| *camel.source.endpoint.exceptionHandler* | To let the consumer use a custom ExceptionHandler. Notice if the option bridgeErrorHandler is enabled then this option is not in use. By default the consumer will deal with exceptions, that will be logged at WARN or ERROR level and ignored. | null | MEDIUM
| *camel.source.endpoint.exchangePattern* | Sets the exchange pattern when the consumer creates an exchange. One of: [InOnly] [InOut] [InOptionalOut] | null | MEDIUM
| *camel.source.endpoint.pollStrategy* | A pluggable org.apache.camel.PollingConsumerPollingStrategy allowing you to provide your custom implementation to control error handling usually occurred during the poll operation before an Exchange have been created and being routed in Camel. | null | MEDIUM
| *camel.source.endpoint.basicPropertyBinding* | Whether the endpoint should use basic property binding (Camel 2.x) or the newer property binding with additional capabilities | false | MEDIUM

| *camel.source.endpoint.fhirContext* | FhirContext is an expensive object to create. To avoid creating multiple instances, it can be set directly. | null | MEDIUM
| *camel.source.endpoint.forceConformanceCheck* | Force conformance check | false | MEDIUM
| *camel.source.endpoint.sessionCookie* | HTTP session cookie to add to every request | null | MEDIUM
| *camel.source.endpoint.socketTimeout* | How long to block for individual read/write operations (in ms) | "10000" | MEDIUM

| *camel.source.endpoint.backoffIdleThreshold* | The number of subsequent idle polls that should happen before the backoffMultipler should kick-in. | null | MEDIUM
| *camel.source.endpoint.backoffMultiplier* | To let the scheduled polling consumer backoff if there has been a number of subsequent idles/errors in a row. The multiplier is then the number of polls that will be skipped before the next actual attempt is happening again. When this option is in use then backoffIdleThreshold and/or backoffErrorThreshold must also be configured. | null | MEDIUM
| *camel.source.endpoint.delay* | Milliseconds before the next poll. | 500L | MEDIUM
| *camel.source.endpoint.greedy* | If greedy is enabled, then the ScheduledPollConsumer will run immediately again, if the previous run polled 1 or more messages. | false | MEDIUM
