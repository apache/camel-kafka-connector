Connector description: Consume and produce records from and to AWS Kinesis Streams using AWS SDK version 2.x.

When using camel-aws2-kinesis-kafka-connector as source make sure to use the following Maven dependency to have support for the connector:

  <version>x.x.x</version>
  <!-- use the same version as your Camel Kafka connector version -->
</dependency>
----

To use this Source connector in Kafka connect you'll need to set the following connector.class

| Name | Description | Default | Required | Priority
| *camel.source.path.streamName* | Name of the stream | null | true | HIGH
| *camel.source.endpoint.amazonKinesisClient* | Amazon Kinesis client to use for all requests for this endpoint | null | false | MEDIUM
| *camel.source.endpoint.cborEnabled* | This option will set the CBOR_ENABLED property during the execution | true | false | MEDIUM
| *camel.source.endpoint.overrideEndpoint* | Set the need for overidding the endpoint. This option needs to be used in combination with uriEndpointOverride option | false | false | MEDIUM
| *camel.source.endpoint.proxyHost* | To define a proxy host when instantiating the Kinesis client | null | false | MEDIUM
| *camel.source.endpoint.proxyPort* | To define a proxy port when instantiating the Kinesis client | null | false | MEDIUM
| *camel.source.endpoint.proxyProtocol* | To define a proxy protocol when instantiating the Kinesis client One of: [HTTP] [HTTPS] | "HTTPS" | false | MEDIUM
| *camel.source.endpoint.region* | The region in which Kinesis Firehose client needs to work. When using this parameter, the configuration will expect the lowercase name of the region (for example ap-east-1) You'll need to use the name Region.EU_WEST_1.id() | null | false | MEDIUM

| *camel.source.endpoint.useDefaultCredentials Provider* | Set whether the Kinesis client should expect to load credentials through a default credentials provider or to expect static credentials to be passed in. | false | false | MEDIUM
| *camel.source.endpoint.bridgeErrorHandler* | Allows for bridging the consumer to the Camel routing Error Handler, which mean any exceptions occurred while the consumer is trying to pickup incoming messages, or the likes, will now be processed as a message and handled by the routing Error Handler. By default the consumer will use the org.apache.camel.spi.ExceptionHandler to deal with exceptions, that will be logged at WARN or ERROR level and ignored. | false | false | MEDIUM
| *camel.source.endpoint.iteratorType* | Defines where in the Kinesis stream to start getting records One of: [AT_SEQUENCE_NUMBER] [AFTER_SEQUENCE_NUMBER] [TRIM_HORIZON] [LATEST] [AT_TIMESTAMP] [null] | "TRIM_HORIZON" | false | MEDIUM
| *camel.source.endpoint.maxResultsPerRequest* | Maximum number of records that will be fetched in each poll | 1 | false | MEDIUM
| *camel.source.endpoint.sendEmptyMessageWhenIdle* | If the polling consumer did not poll any files, you can enable this option to send an empty message (no body) instead. | false | false | MEDIUM

In case of ignore a message will be logged and the consumer will restart from the beginning,in case of silent there will be no logging and the consumer will start from the beginning,in case of fail a ReachedClosedStateException will be raised One of: [ignore] [fail] [silent] | "ignore" | false | MEDIUM
| *camel.source.endpoint.shardId* | Defines which shardId in the Kinesis stream to get records from | null | false | MEDIUM

| *camel.source.endpoint.backoffMultiplier* | To let the scheduled polling consumer backoff if there has been a number of subsequent idles/errors in a row. The multiplier is then the number of polls that will be skipped before the next actual attempt is happening again.

| *camel.source.endpoint.delay* | Milliseconds before the next poll. | 500L | false | MEDIUM
| *camel.source.endpoint.greedy* | If greedy is enabled, then the ScheduledPollConsumer will run immediately again, if the previous run polled 1 or more messages. | false | false | MEDIUM
| *camel.source.endpoint.initialDelay* | Milliseconds before the first poll starts. | 1000L | false | MEDIUM
| *camel.source.endpoint.repeatCount* | Specifies a maximum limit of number of fires. So if you set it to 1, the scheduler will only fire once. If you set it to 5, it will only fire five times. A value of zero or negative means fire forever. | 0L | false | MEDIUM
| *camel.source.endpoint.runLoggingLevel* | The consumer logs a start/complete log line when it polls. This option allows you to configure the logging level for that. One of: [TRACE] [DEBUG] [INFO] [WARN] [ERROR] [OFF] | "TRACE" | false | MEDIUM
