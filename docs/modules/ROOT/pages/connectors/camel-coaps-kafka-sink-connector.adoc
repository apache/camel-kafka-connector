= camel-coaps-kafka-connector sink configuration

When using camel-coaps-kafka-connector as sink make sure to use the following Maven dependency to have support for the connector:

[source,xml]
----
<dependency>
  <groupId>org.apache.camel.kafkaconnector</groupId>
  <artifactId>camel-coaps-kafka-connector</artifactId>
  <version>x.x.x</version>
  <!-- use the same version as your Camel Kafka connector version -->
</dependency>
----

To use this Sink connector in Kafka connect you'll need to set the following connector.class

[source,java]
----
connector.class=org.apache.camel.kafkaconnector.coaps.CamelCoapsSinkConnector
----


The camel-coaps sink connector supports 15 options, which are listed below.



[width="100%",cols="2,5,^1,2",options="header"]
|===
| Name | Description | Default | Priority
| *camel.sink.path.uri* | The URI for the CoAP endpoint | null | MEDIUM
| *camel.sink.endpoint.alias* | Sets the alias used to query the KeyStore for the private key and certificate. This parameter is used when we are enabling TLS with certificates on the service side, and similarly on the client side when TLS is used with certificates and client authentication. If the parameter is not specified then the default behavior is to use the first alias in the keystore that contains a key entry. This configuration parameter does not apply to configuring TLS via a Raw Public Key or a Pre-Shared Key. | null | MEDIUM
| *camel.sink.endpoint.cipherSuites* | Sets the cipherSuites String. This is a comma separated String of ciphersuites to configure. If it is not specified, then it falls back to getting the ciphersuites from the sslContextParameters object. | null | MEDIUM
| *camel.sink.endpoint.clientAuthentication* | Sets the configuration options for server-side client-authentication requirements. The value must be one of NONE, WANT, REQUIRE. If this value is not specified, then it falls back to checking the sslContextParameters.getServerParameters().getClientAuthentication() value. | null | MEDIUM
| *camel.sink.endpoint.privateKey* | Set the configured private key for use with Raw Public Key. | null | MEDIUM
| *camel.sink.endpoint.pskStore* | Set the PskStore to use for pre-shared key. | null | MEDIUM
| *camel.sink.endpoint.publicKey* | Set the configured public key for use with Raw Public Key. | null | MEDIUM
| *camel.sink.endpoint.recommendedCipherSuitesOnly* | The CBC cipher suites are not recommended. If you want to use them, you first need to set the recommendedCipherSuitesOnly option to false. | true | MEDIUM
| *camel.sink.endpoint.sslContextParameters* | Set the SSLContextParameters object for setting up TLS. This is required for coapstcp, and for coaps when we are using certificates for TLS (as opposed to RPK or PKS). | null | MEDIUM
| *camel.sink.endpoint.trustedRpkStore* | Set the TrustedRpkStore to use to determine trust in raw public keys. | null | MEDIUM
| *camel.sink.endpoint.lazyStartProducer* | Whether the producer should be started lazy (on the first message). By starting lazy you can use this to allow CamelContext and routes to startup in situations where a producer may otherwise fail during starting and cause the route to fail being started. By deferring this startup to be lazy then the startup failure can be handled during routing messages via Camel's routing error handlers. Beware that when the first message is processed then creating and starting the producer may take a little time and prolong the total processing time of the processing. | false | MEDIUM
| *camel.sink.endpoint.basicPropertyBinding* | Whether the endpoint should use basic property binding (Camel 2.x) or the newer property binding with additional capabilities | false | MEDIUM
| *camel.sink.endpoint.synchronous* | Sets whether synchronous processing should be strictly used, or Camel is allowed to use asynchronous processing (if supported). | false | MEDIUM
| *camel.component.coaps.lazyStartProducer* | Whether the producer should be started lazy (on the first message). By starting lazy you can use this to allow CamelContext and routes to startup in situations where a producer may otherwise fail during starting and cause the route to fail being started. By deferring this startup to be lazy then the startup failure can be handled during routing messages via Camel's routing error handlers. Beware that when the first message is processed then creating and starting the producer may take a little time and prolong the total processing time of the processing. | false | MEDIUM
| *camel.component.coaps.basicPropertyBinding* | Whether the component should use basic property binding (Camel 2.x) or the newer property binding with additional capabilities | false | LOW
