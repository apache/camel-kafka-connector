= camel-nats-kafka-connector sink configuration

When using camel-nats-kafka-connector as sink make sure to use the following Maven dependency to have support for the connector:

[source,xml]
----
<dependency>
  <groupId>org.apache.camel.kafkaconnector</groupId>
  <artifactId>camel-nats-kafka-connector</artifactId>
  <version>x.x.x</version>
  <!-- use the same version as your Camel Kafka connector version -->
</dependency>
----

To use this Sink connector in Kafka connect you'll need to set the following connector.class

[source,java]
----
connector.class=org.apache.camel.kafkaconnector.nats.CamelNatsSinkConnector
----


The camel-nats sink connector supports 26 options, which are listed below.



[width="100%",cols="2,5,^1,1,1",options="header"]
|===
| Name | Description | Default | Required | Priority
| *camel.sink.path.topic* | The name of topic we want to use | null | true | HIGH
| *camel.sink.endpoint.connectionTimeout* | Timeout for connection attempts. (in milliseconds) | 2000 | false | MEDIUM
| *camel.sink.endpoint.flushConnection* | Define if we want to flush connection when stopping or not | true | false | MEDIUM
| *camel.sink.endpoint.flushTimeout* | Set the flush timeout (in milliseconds) | 1000 | false | MEDIUM
| *camel.sink.endpoint.maxPingsOut* | maximum number of pings have not received a response allowed by the client | 2 | false | MEDIUM
| *camel.sink.endpoint.maxReconnectAttempts* | Max reconnection attempts | 60 | false | MEDIUM
| *camel.sink.endpoint.noEcho* | Turn off echo. If supported by the gnatsd version you are connecting to this flag will prevent the server from echoing messages back to the connection if it has subscriptions on the subject being published to. | false | false | MEDIUM
| *camel.sink.endpoint.noRandomizeServers* | Whether or not randomizing the order of servers for the connection attempts | false | false | MEDIUM
| *camel.sink.endpoint.pedantic* | Whether or not running in pedantic mode (this affects performance) | false | false | MEDIUM
| *camel.sink.endpoint.pingInterval* | Ping interval to be aware if connection is still alive (in milliseconds) | 120000 | false | MEDIUM
| *camel.sink.endpoint.reconnect* | Whether or not using reconnection feature | true | false | MEDIUM
| *camel.sink.endpoint.reconnectTimeWait* | Waiting time before attempts reconnection (in milliseconds) | 2000 | false | MEDIUM
| *camel.sink.endpoint.requestCleanupInterval* | Interval to clean up cancelled/timed out requests. | 5000 | false | MEDIUM
| *camel.sink.endpoint.servers* | URLs to one or more NAT servers. Use comma to separate URLs when specifying multiple servers. | null | false | MEDIUM
| *camel.sink.endpoint.verbose* | Whether or not running in verbose mode | false | false | MEDIUM
| *camel.sink.endpoint.lazyStartProducer* | Whether the producer should be started lazy (on the first message). By starting lazy you can use this to allow CamelContext and routes to startup in situations where a producer may otherwise fail during starting and cause the route to fail being started. By deferring this startup to be lazy then the startup failure can be handled during routing messages via Camel's routing error handlers. Beware that when the first message is processed then creating and starting the producer may take a little time and prolong the total processing time of the processing. | false | false | MEDIUM
| *camel.sink.endpoint.replySubject* | the subject to which subscribers should send response | null | false | MEDIUM
| *camel.sink.endpoint.connection* | Reference an already instantiated connection to Nats server | null | false | MEDIUM
| *camel.sink.endpoint.traceConnection* | Whether or not connection trace messages should be printed to standard out for fine grained debugging of connection issues. | false | false | MEDIUM
| *camel.sink.endpoint.secure* | Set secure option indicating TLS is required | false | false | MEDIUM
| *camel.sink.endpoint.sslContextParameters* | To configure security using SSLContextParameters | null | false | MEDIUM
| *camel.component.nats.servers* | URLs to one or more NAT servers. Use comma to separate URLs when specifying multiple servers. | null | false | MEDIUM
| *camel.component.nats.verbose* | Whether or not running in verbose mode | false | false | MEDIUM
| *camel.component.nats.lazyStartProducer* | Whether the producer should be started lazy (on the first message). By starting lazy you can use this to allow CamelContext and routes to startup in situations where a producer may otherwise fail during starting and cause the route to fail being started. By deferring this startup to be lazy then the startup failure can be handled during routing messages via Camel's routing error handlers. Beware that when the first message is processed then creating and starting the producer may take a little time and prolong the total processing time of the processing. | false | false | MEDIUM
| *camel.component.nats.autowiredEnabled* | Whether autowiring is enabled. This is used for automatic autowiring options (the option must be marked as autowired) by looking up in the registry to find if there is a single instance of matching type, which then gets configured on the component. This can be used for automatic configuring JDBC data sources, JMS connection factories, AWS Clients, etc. | true | false | MEDIUM
| *camel.component.nats.useGlobalSslContextParameters* | Enable usage of global SSL context parameters. | false | false | MEDIUM
