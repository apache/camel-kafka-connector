When using camel-weather-kafka-connector as source make sure to use the following Maven dependency to have support for the connector:

[source,xml]
----
<dependency>
  <groupId>org.apache.camel.kafkaconnector</groupId>
  <artifactId>camel-weather-kafka-connector</artifactId>
  <version>x.x.x</version>
  <!-- use the same version as your Camel Kafka connector version -->
</dependency>
----

To use this Source connector in Kafka connect you'll need to set the following connector.class

[source,java]
----
connector.class=org.apache.camel.kafkaconnector.weather.CamelWeatherSourceConnector
----


The camel-weather source connector supports 44 options, which are listed below.



[width="100%",cols="2,5,^1,2",options="header"]
|===
| Name | Description | Default | Priority
| *camel.source.path.name* | The name value is not used. | null | HIGH
| *camel.source.endpoint.appid* | APPID ID used to authenticate the user connected to the API Server | null | HIGH
| *camel.source.endpoint.headerName* | To store the weather result in this header instead of the message body. This is useable if you want to keep current message body as-is. | null | MEDIUM
| *camel.source.endpoint.language* | Language of the response. One of: [en] [ru] [it] [es] [sp] [uk] [ua] [de] [pt] [ro] [pl] [fi] [nl] [fr] [bg] [sv] [se] [zh_tw] [zh] [zh_cn] [tr] [hr] [ca] | "en" | MEDIUM
| *camel.source.endpoint.mode* | The output format of the weather data. One of: [HTML] [JSON] [XML] | "JSON" | MEDIUM
| *camel.source.endpoint.period* | If null, the current weather will be returned, else use values of 5, 7, 14 days. Only the numeric value for the forecast period is actually parsed, so spelling, capitalisation of the time period is up to you (its ignored) | null | MEDIUM
| *camel.source.endpoint.units* | The units for temperature measurement. One of: [IMPERIAL] [METRIC] | null | MEDIUM
| *camel.source.endpoint.weatherApi* | The API to use (current, forecast/3 hour, forecast daily, station) One of: [Current] [Station] [Hourly] [Daily] | null | MEDIUM
| *camel.source.endpoint.bridgeErrorHandler* | Allows for bridging the consumer to the Camel routing Error Handler, which mean any exceptions occurred while the consumer is trying to pickup incoming messages, or the likes, will now be processed as a message and handled by the routing Error Handler. By default the consumer will use the org.apache.camel.spi.ExceptionHandler to deal with exceptions, that will be logged at WARN or ERROR level and ignored. | false | MEDIUM
| *camel.source.endpoint.sendEmptyMessageWhenIdle* | If the polling consumer did not poll any files, you can enable this option to send an empty message (no body) instead. | false | MEDIUM
| *camel.source.endpoint.exceptionHandler* | To let the consumer use a custom ExceptionHandler. Notice if the option bridgeErrorHandler is enabled then this option is not in use. By default the consumer will deal with exceptions, that will be logged at WARN or ERROR level and ignored. | null | MEDIUM
| *camel.source.endpoint.exchangePattern* | Sets the exchange pattern when the consumer creates an exchange. One of: [InOnly] [InOut] [InOptionalOut] | null | MEDIUM
| *camel.source.endpoint.pollStrategy* | A pluggable org.apache.camel.PollingConsumerPollingStrategy allowing you to provide your custom implementation to control error handling usually occurred during the poll operation before an Exchange have been created and being routed in Camel. | null | MEDIUM
| *camel.source.endpoint.basicPropertyBinding* | Whether the endpoint should use basic property binding (Camel 2.x) or the newer property binding with additional capabilities | false | MEDIUM
| *camel.source.endpoint.geoLocationProvider* | A custum geolocation provider to determine the longitude and latitude to use when no location information is set. The default implementaion uses the ipstack API and requires geolocationAccessKey and geolocationRequestHostIP | null | MEDIUM
| *camel.source.endpoint.httpClient* | To use an existing configured http client (for example with http proxy) | null | MEDIUM
| *camel.source.endpoint.synchronous* | Sets whether synchronous processing should be strictly used, or Camel is allowed to use asynchronous processing (if supported). | false | MEDIUM
| *camel.source.endpoint.cnt* | Number of results to be found | null | MEDIUM
| *camel.source.endpoint.ids* | List of id's of city/stations. You can separate multiple ids by comma. | null | MEDIUM
| *camel.source.endpoint.lat* | Latitude of location. You can use lat and lon options instead of location. For boxed queries this is the bottom latitude. | null | MEDIUM
| *camel.source.endpoint.location* | If null Camel will try and determine your current location using the geolocation of your ip address, else specify the city,country. For well known city names, Open Weather Map will determine the best fit, but multiple results may be returned. Hence specifying and country as well will return more accurate data. If you specify current as the location then the component will try to get the current latitude and longitude and use that to get the weather details. You can use lat and lon options instead of location. | null | MEDIUM
| *camel.source.endpoint.lon* | Longitude of location. You can use lat and lon options instead of location. For boxed queries this is the left longtitude. | null | MEDIUM
| *camel.source.endpoint.rightLon* | For boxed queries this is the right longtitude. Needs to be used in combination with topLat and zoom. | null | MEDIUM
| *camel.source.endpoint.topLat* | For boxed queries this is the top latitude. Needs to be used in combination with rightLon and zoom. | null | MEDIUM
| *camel.source.endpoint.zip* | Zip-code, e.g. 94040,us | null | MEDIUM
| *camel.source.endpoint.zoom* | For boxed queries this is the zoom. Needs to be used in combination with rightLon and topLat. | null | MEDIUM
| *camel.source.endpoint.backoffErrorThreshold* | The number of subsequent error polls (failed due some error) that should happen before the backoffMultipler should kick-in. | null | MEDIUM
| *camel.source.endpoint.backoffIdleThreshold* | The number of subsequent idle polls that should happen before the backoffMultipler should kick-in. | null | MEDIUM
| *camel.source.endpoint.backoffMultiplier* | To let the scheduled polling consumer backoff if there has been a number of subsequent idles/errors in a row. The multiplier is then the number of polls that will be skipped before the next actual attempt is happening again. When this option is in use then backoffIdleThreshold and/or backoffErrorThreshold must also be configured. | null | MEDIUM
| *camel.source.endpoint.delay* | Milliseconds before the next poll. | 500L | MEDIUM
| *camel.source.endpoint.greedy* | If greedy is enabled, then the ScheduledPollConsumer will run immediately again, if the previous run polled 1 or more messages. | false | MEDIUM
| *camel.source.endpoint.initialDelay* | Milliseconds before the first poll starts. | 1000L | MEDIUM
| *camel.source.endpoint.repeatCount* | Specifies a maximum limit of number of fires. So if you set it to 1, the scheduler will only fire once. If you set it to 5, it will only fire five times. A value of zero or negative means fire forever. | 0L | MEDIUM
| *camel.source.endpoint.runLoggingLevel* | The consumer logs a start/complete log line when it polls. This option allows you to configure the logging level for that. One of: [TRACE] [DEBUG] [INFO] [WARN] [ERROR] [OFF] | "TRACE" | MEDIUM
| *camel.source.endpoint.scheduledExecutorService* | Allows for configuring a custom/shared thread pool to use for the consumer. By default each consumer has its own single threaded thread pool. | null | MEDIUM
| *camel.source.endpoint.scheduler* | To use a cron scheduler from either camel-spring or camel-quartz component. Use value spring or quartz for built in scheduler | "none" | MEDIUM
| *camel.source.endpoint.schedulerProperties* | To configure additional properties when using a custom scheduler or any of the Quartz, Spring based scheduler. | null | MEDIUM
| *camel.source.endpoint.startScheduler* | Whether the scheduler should be auto started. | true | MEDIUM
| *camel.source.endpoint.timeUnit* | Time unit for initialDelay and delay options. One of: [NANOSECONDS] [MICROSECONDS] [MILLISECONDS] [SECONDS] [MINUTES] [HOURS] [DAYS] | "MILLISECONDS" | MEDIUM
| *camel.source.endpoint.useFixedDelay* | Controls if fixed delay or fixed rate is used. See ScheduledExecutorService in JDK for details. | true | MEDIUM
| *camel.source.endpoint.geolocationAccessKey* | The geolocation service now needs an accessKey to be used | null | HIGH
| *camel.source.endpoint.geolocationRequestHostIP* | The geolocation service now needs to specify the IP associated to the accessKey you're using | null | HIGH
| *camel.component.weather.bridgeErrorHandler* | Allows for bridging the consumer to the Camel routing Error Handler, which mean any exceptions occurred while the consumer is trying to pickup incoming messages, or the likes, will now be processed as a message and handled by the routing Error Handler. By default the consumer will use the org.apache.camel.spi.ExceptionHandler to deal with exceptions, that will be logged at WARN or ERROR level and ignored. | false | MEDIUM
| *camel.component.weather.basicPropertyBinding* | Whether the component should use basic property binding (Camel 2.x) or the newer property binding with additional capabilities | false | LOW
