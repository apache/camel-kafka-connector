// kafka-connector options: START
== camel-jt400-kafka-connector source configuration

When using camel-jt400-kafka-connector as sink make sure to use the following Maven dependency to have support for the connector:

[source,xml]
----
<dependency>
  <groupId>org.apache.camel.kafkaconnector</groupId>
  <artifactId>camel-jt400-kafka-connector</artifactId>
  <version>x.x.x</version>
  <!-- use the same version as your Camel Kafka connector version -->
</dependency>

|===
| Name | Description | Default | Priority
| *camel.sink.path.userID* | Returns the ID of the AS/400 user. | null | ConfigDef.Importance.HIGH
| *camel.sink.path.password* | Returns the password of the AS/400 user. | null | ConfigDef.Importance.HIGH
| *camel.sink.path.systemName* | Returns the name of the AS/400 system. | null | ConfigDef.Importance.HIGH
| *camel.sink.path.objectPath* | Returns the fully qualified integrated file system path name of the target object of this endpoint. | null | ConfigDef.Importance.HIGH
| *camel.sink.path.type* | Whether to work with data queues or remote program call One of: [DTAQ] [PGM] [SRVPGM] | null | ConfigDef.Importance.HIGH
| *camel.sink.endpoint.ccsid* | Sets the CCSID to use for the connection with the AS/400 system. | null | ConfigDef.Importance.MEDIUM
| *camel.sink.endpoint.format* | Sets the data format for sending messages. One of: [text] [binary] | "text" | ConfigDef.Importance.MEDIUM
| *camel.sink.endpoint.guiAvailable* | Sets whether AS/400 prompting is enabled in the environment running Camel. | false | ConfigDef.Importance.MEDIUM
| *camel.sink.endpoint.keyed* | Whether to use keyed or non-keyed data queues. | false | ConfigDef.Importance.MEDIUM
| *camel.sink.endpoint.searchKey* | Search key for keyed data queues. | null | ConfigDef.Importance.MEDIUM
| *camel.sink.endpoint.lazyStartProducer* | Whether the producer should be started lazy (on the first message). By starting lazy you can use this to allow CamelContext and routes to startup in situations where a producer may otherwise fail during starting and cause the route to fail being started. By deferring this startup to be lazy then the startup failure can be handled during routing messages via Camel's routing error handlers. Beware that when the first message is processed then creating and starting the producer may take a little time and prolong the total processing time of the processing. | false | ConfigDef.Importance.MEDIUM
| *camel.sink.endpoint.outputFieldsIdxArray* | Specifies which fields (program parameters) are output parameters. | null | ConfigDef.Importance.MEDIUM
| *camel.sink.endpoint.outputFieldsLengthArray* | Specifies the fields (program parameters) length as in the AS/400 program definition. | null | ConfigDef.Importance.MEDIUM
| *camel.sink.endpoint.procedureName* | Procedure name from a service program to call | null | ConfigDef.Importance.MEDIUM
| *camel.sink.endpoint.basicPropertyBinding* | Whether the endpoint should use basic property binding (Camel 2.x) or the newer property binding with additional capabilities | false | ConfigDef.Importance.MEDIUM
| *camel.sink.endpoint.synchronous* | Sets whether synchronous processing should be strictly used, or Camel is allowed to use asynchronous processing (if supported). | false | ConfigDef.Importance.MEDIUM
| *camel.sink.endpoint.secured* | Whether connections to AS/400 are secured with SSL. | false | ConfigDef.Importance.MEDIUM
| *camel.component.jt400.lazyStartProducer* | Whether the producer should be started lazy (on the first message). By starting lazy you can use this to allow CamelContext and routes to startup in situations where a producer may otherwise fail during starting and cause the route to fail being started. By deferring this startup to be lazy then the startup failure can be handled during routing messages via Camel's routing error handlers. Beware that when the first message is processed then creating and starting the producer may take a little time and prolong the total processing time of the processing. | false | ConfigDef.Importance.MEDIUM
| *camel.component.jt400.basicPropertyBinding* | Whether the component should use basic property binding (Camel 2.x) or the newer property binding with additional capabilities | false | ConfigDef.Importance.MEDIUM
| *camel.component.jt400.connectionPool* | Default connection pool used by the component. Note that this pool is lazily initialized. This is because in a scenario where the user always provides a pool, it would be wasteful for Camel to initialize and keep an idle pool. | null | ConfigDef.Importance.MEDIUM
