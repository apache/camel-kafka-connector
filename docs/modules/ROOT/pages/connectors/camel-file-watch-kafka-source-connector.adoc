= camel-file-watch-kafka-connector source configuration

When using camel-file-watch-kafka-connector as source make sure to use the following Maven dependency to have support for the connector:

[source,xml]
----
<dependency>
  <groupId>org.apache.camel.kafkaconnector</groupId>
  <artifactId>camel-file-watch-kafka-connector</artifactId>
  <version>x.x.x</version>
  <!-- use the same version as your Camel Kafka connector version -->
</dependency>
----

To use this Source connector in Kafka connect you'll need to set the following connector.class

[source,java]
----
connector.class=org.apache.camel.kafkaconnector.filewatch.CamelFilewatchSourceConnector
----


The camel-file-watch source connector supports 22 options, which are listed below.



[width="100%",cols="2,5,^1,2",options="header"]
|===
| Name | Description | Default | Priority
| *camel.source.path.path* | Path of directory to consume events from. | null | HIGH
| *camel.source.endpoint.antInclude* | ANT style pattern to match files. The file is matched against path relative to endpoint path. Pattern must be also relative (not starting with slash) | "**" | MEDIUM
| *camel.source.endpoint.autoCreate* | Auto create directory if does not exists. | true | MEDIUM
| *camel.source.endpoint.bridgeErrorHandler* | Allows for bridging the consumer to the Camel routing Error Handler, which mean any exceptions occurred while the consumer is trying to pickup incoming messages, or the likes, will now be processed as a message and handled by the routing Error Handler. By default the consumer will use the org.apache.camel.spi.ExceptionHandler to deal with exceptions, that will be logged at WARN or ERROR level and ignored. | false | MEDIUM
| *camel.source.endpoint.concurrentConsumers* | The number of concurrent consumers. Increase this value, if your route is slow to prevent buffering in queue. | 1 | MEDIUM
| *camel.source.endpoint.events* | Comma separated list of events to watch. One of: [CREATE] [MODIFY] [DELETE] | "CREATE,MODIFY,DELETE" | MEDIUM
| *camel.source.endpoint.fileHasher* | Reference to io.methvin.watcher.hashing.FileHasher. This prevents emitting duplicate events on some platforms. For working with large files and if you dont need detect multiple modifications per second per file, use #lastModifiedTimeFileHasher. You can also provide custom implementation in registry. | "#murmur3FFileHasher" | MEDIUM
| *camel.source.endpoint.pollThreads* | The number of threads polling WatchService. Increase this value, if you see OVERFLOW messages in log. | 1 | MEDIUM
| *camel.source.endpoint.queueSize* | Maximum size of queue between WatchService and consumer. Unbounded by default. | 2147483647 | MEDIUM
| *camel.source.endpoint.recursive* | Watch recursive in current and child directories (including newly created directories). | true | MEDIUM
| *camel.source.endpoint.useFileHashing* | Enables or disables file hashing to detect duplicate events. If you disable this, you can get some events multiple times on some platforms and JDKs. Check java.nio.file.WatchService limitations for your target platform. | true | MEDIUM
| *camel.source.endpoint.exceptionHandler* | To let the consumer use a custom ExceptionHandler. Notice if the option bridgeErrorHandler is enabled then this option is not in use. By default the consumer will deal with exceptions, that will be logged at WARN or ERROR level and ignored. | null | MEDIUM
| *camel.source.endpoint.exchangePattern* | Sets the exchange pattern when the consumer creates an exchange. One of: [InOnly] [InOut] [InOptionalOut] | null | MEDIUM
| *camel.source.endpoint.basicPropertyBinding* | Whether the endpoint should use basic property binding (Camel 2.x) or the newer property binding with additional capabilities | false | MEDIUM
| *camel.source.endpoint.synchronous* | Sets whether synchronous processing should be strictly used, or Camel is allowed to use asynchronous processing (if supported). | false | MEDIUM
| *camel.component.file-watch.bridgeErrorHandler* | Allows for bridging the consumer to the Camel routing Error Handler, which mean any exceptions occurred while the consumer is trying to pickup incoming messages, or the likes, will now be processed as a message and handled by the routing Error Handler. By default the consumer will use the org.apache.camel.spi.ExceptionHandler to deal with exceptions, that will be logged at WARN or ERROR level and ignored. | false | MEDIUM
| *camel.component.file-watch.concurrentConsumers* | The number of concurrent consumers. Increase this value, if your route is slow to prevent buffering in queue. | 1 | MEDIUM
| *camel.component.file-watch.fileHasher* | Reference to io.methvin.watcher.hashing.FileHasher. This prevents emitting duplicate events on some platforms. For working with large files and if you dont need detect multiple modifications per second per file, use #lastModifiedTimeFileHasher. You can also provide custom implementation in registry. | "#murmur3FFileHasher" | MEDIUM
| *camel.component.file-watch.pollThreads* | The number of threads polling WatchService. Increase this value, if you see OVERFLOW messages in log. | 1 | MEDIUM
| *camel.component.file-watch.queueSize* | Maximum size of queue between WatchService and consumer. Unbounded by default. | 2147483647 | MEDIUM
| *camel.component.file-watch.useFileHashing* | Enables or disables file hashing to detect duplicate events. If you disable this, you can get some events multiple times on some platforms and JDKs. Check java.nio.file.WatchService limitations for your target platform. | true | MEDIUM
| *camel.component.file-watch.basicPropertyBinding* | Whether the component should use basic property binding (Camel 2.x) or the newer property binding with additional capabilities | false | LOW
