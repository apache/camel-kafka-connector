Connector Description: Send data to a MySQL Database.

In you KameletBinding file you'll need to explicitly declare the SQL Server driver dependency in spec->integration->dependencies

- "mvn:mysql:mysql-connector-java:<version>"

This Kamelet expects a JSON as body. The mapping between the JSON fields and parameters is done by key, so if you have the following query:

'INSERT INTO accounts (username,city) VALUES (:#username,:#city)'

The Kamelet needs to receive as input something like:

'{ "username":"oscerd", "city":"Rome"}'
