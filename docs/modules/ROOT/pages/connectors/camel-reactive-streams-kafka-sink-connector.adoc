= camel-reactive-streams-kafka-connector sink configuration

When using camel-reactive-streams-kafka-connector as sink make sure to use the following Maven dependency to have support for the connector:

[source,xml]
----
<dependency>
  <groupId>org.apache.camel.kafkaconnector</groupId>
  <artifactId>camel-reactive-streams-kafka-connector</artifactId>
  <version>x.x.x</version>
  <!-- use the same version as your Camel Kafka connector version -->
</dependency>
----

To use this Sink connector in Kafka connect you'll need to set the following connector.class

[source,java]
----
connector.class=org.apache.camel.kafkaconnector.reactivestreams.CamelReactivestreamsSinkConnector
----


The camel-reactive-streams sink connector supports 12 options, which are listed below.



[width="100%",cols="2,5,^1,1,1",options="header"]
|===
| Name | Description | Default | Required | Priority
| *camel.sink.path.stream* | Name of the stream channel used by the endpoint to exchange messages. | null | false | MEDIUM
| *camel.sink.endpoint.backpressureStrategy* | The backpressure strategy to use when pushing events to a slow subscriber. One of: [BUFFER] [OLDEST] [LATEST] | null | false | MEDIUM
| *camel.sink.endpoint.lazyStartProducer* | Whether the producer should be started lazy (on the first message). By starting lazy you can use this to allow CamelContext and routes to startup in situations where a producer may otherwise fail during starting and cause the route to fail being started. By deferring this startup to be lazy then the startup failure can be handled during routing messages via Camel's routing error handlers. Beware that when the first message is processed then creating and starting the producer may take a little time and prolong the total processing time of the processing. | false | false | MEDIUM
| *camel.sink.endpoint.synchronous* | Sets whether synchronous processing should be strictly used, or Camel is allowed to use asynchronous processing (if supported). | false | false | MEDIUM
| *camel.component.reactive-streams.threadPoolMaxSize* | The maximum number of threads used by the reactive streams internal engine. | 10 | false | MEDIUM
| *camel.component.reactive-streams.threadPoolMinSize* | The minimum number of threads used by the reactive streams internal engine. | null | false | MEDIUM
| *camel.component.reactive-streams.threadPoolName* | The name of the thread pool used by the reactive streams internal engine. | "CamelReactiveStreamsWorker" | false | MEDIUM
| *camel.component.reactive-streams.backpressure Strategy* | The backpressure strategy to use when pushing events to a slow subscriber. One of: [BUFFER] [OLDEST] [LATEST] | "BUFFER" | false | MEDIUM
| *camel.component.reactive-streams.lazyStartProducer* | Whether the producer should be started lazy (on the first message). By starting lazy you can use this to allow CamelContext and routes to startup in situations where a producer may otherwise fail during starting and cause the route to fail being started. By deferring this startup to be lazy then the startup failure can be handled during routing messages via Camel's routing error handlers. Beware that when the first message is processed then creating and starting the producer may take a little time and prolong the total processing time of the processing. | false | false | MEDIUM
| *camel.component.reactive-streams.autowiredEnabled* | Whether autowiring is enabled. This is used for automatic autowiring options (the option must be marked as autowired) by looking up in the registry to find if there is a single instance of matching type, which then gets configured on the component. This can be used for automatic configuring JDBC data sources, JMS connection factories, AWS Clients, etc. | true | false | MEDIUM
| *camel.component.reactive-streams.reactiveStreams EngineConfiguration* | To use an existing reactive stream engine configuration. | null | false | MEDIUM
| *camel.component.reactive-streams.serviceType* | Set the type of the underlying reactive streams implementation to use. The implementation is looked up from the registry or using a ServiceLoader, the default implementation is DefaultCamelReactiveStreamsService | null | false | MEDIUM
