= camel-hazelcast-list-kafka-connector sink configuration

When using camel-hazelcast-list-kafka-connector as sink make sure to use the following Maven dependency to have support for the connector:

[source,xml]
----
<dependency>
  <groupId>org.apache.camel.kafkaconnector</groupId>
  <artifactId>camel-hazelcast-list-kafka-connector</artifactId>
  <version>x.x.x</version>
  <!-- use the same version as your Camel Kafka connector version -->
</dependency>
----

To use this Sink connector in Kafka connect you'll need to set the following connector.class

[source,java]
----
connector.class=org.apache.camel.kafkaconnector.hazelcastlist.CamelHazelcastlistSinkConnector
----


The camel-hazelcast-list sink connector supports 11 options, which are listed below.



[width="100%",cols="2,5,^1,2",options="header"]
|===
| Name | Description | Default | Priority
| *camel.sink.path.cacheName* | The name of the cache | null | HIGH
| *camel.sink.endpoint.defaultOperation* | To specify a default operation to use, if no operation header has been provided. One of: [put] [delete] [get] [update] [query] [getAll] [clear] [putIfAbsent] [allAll] [removeAll] [retainAll] [evict] [evictAll] [valueCount] [containsKey] [containsValue] [keySet] [removevalue] [increment] [decrement] [setvalue] [destroy] [compareAndSet] [getAndAdd] [add] [offer] [peek] [poll] [remainingCapacity] [drainTo] [removeIf] [take] [publish] [readOnceHeal] [readOnceTail] [capacity] | null | MEDIUM
| *camel.sink.endpoint.hazelcastInstance* | The hazelcast instance reference which can be used for hazelcast endpoint. | null | MEDIUM
| *camel.sink.endpoint.hazelcastInstanceName* | The hazelcast instance reference name which can be used for hazelcast endpoint. If you don't specify the instance reference, camel use the default hazelcast instance from the camel-hazelcast instance. | null | MEDIUM
| *camel.sink.endpoint.lazyStartProducer* | Whether the producer should be started lazy (on the first message). By starting lazy you can use this to allow CamelContext and routes to startup in situations where a producer may otherwise fail during starting and cause the route to fail being started. By deferring this startup to be lazy then the startup failure can be handled during routing messages via Camel's routing error handlers. Beware that when the first message is processed then creating and starting the producer may take a little time and prolong the total processing time of the processing. | false | MEDIUM
| *camel.sink.endpoint.basicPropertyBinding* | Whether the endpoint should use basic property binding (Camel 2.x) or the newer property binding with additional capabilities | false | MEDIUM
| *camel.sink.endpoint.synchronous* | Sets whether synchronous processing should be strictly used, or Camel is allowed to use asynchronous processing (if supported). | false | MEDIUM
| *camel.component.hazelcast-list.lazyStartProducer* | Whether the producer should be started lazy (on the first message). By starting lazy you can use this to allow CamelContext and routes to startup in situations where a producer may otherwise fail during starting and cause the route to fail being started. By deferring this startup to be lazy then the startup failure can be handled during routing messages via Camel's routing error handlers. Beware that when the first message is processed then creating and starting the producer may take a little time and prolong the total processing time of the processing. | false | MEDIUM
| *camel.component.hazelcast-list.basicProperty Binding* | Whether the component should use basic property binding (Camel 2.x) or the newer property binding with additional capabilities | false | LOW
| *camel.component.hazelcast-list.hazelcastInstance* | The hazelcast instance reference which can be used for hazelcast endpoint. If you don't specify the instance reference, camel use the default hazelcast instance from the camel-hazelcast instance. | null | MEDIUM
| *camel.component.hazelcast-list.hazelcastMode* | The hazelcast mode reference which kind of instance should be used. If you don't specify the mode, then the node mode will be the default. | "node" | MEDIUM
