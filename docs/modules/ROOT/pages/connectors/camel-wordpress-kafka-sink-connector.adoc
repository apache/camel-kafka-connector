[width="100%",cols="2,5,^1,1,1",options="header"]
|===
| Name | Description | Default | Required | Priority
| *camel.sink.path.operation* | The endpoint operation. One of: [post] [user] | null | true | HIGH
| *camel.sink.path.operationDetail* | The second part of an endpoint operation. Needed only when endpoint semantic is not enough, like wordpress:post:delete One of: [delete] | null | false | MEDIUM
| *camel.sink.endpoint.apiVersion* | The Wordpress REST API version | "2" | false | MEDIUM
| *camel.sink.endpoint.criteria* | The criteria to use with complex searches. | null | false | MEDIUM
| *camel.sink.endpoint.force* | Whether to bypass trash and force deletion. | false | false | MEDIUM
| *camel.sink.endpoint.id* | The entity ID. Should be passed when the operation performed requires a specific entity, e.g. deleting a post | null | false | MEDIUM
| *camel.sink.endpoint.password* | Password from authorized user | null | false | MEDIUM
| *camel.sink.endpoint.searchCriteria* | Search criteria | null | false | MEDIUM
| *camel.sink.endpoint.url* | The Wordpress API URL from your site, e.g. \http://myblog.com/wp-json/ | null | true | HIGH
| *camel.sink.endpoint.user* | Authorized user to perform writing operations | null | false | MEDIUM
| *camel.sink.endpoint.lazyStartProducer* | Whether the producer should be started lazy (on the first message). By starting lazy you can use this to allow CamelContext and routes to startup in situations where a producer may otherwise fail during starting and cause the route to fail being started. By deferring this startup to be lazy then the startup failure can be handled during routing messages via Camel's routing error handlers. Beware that when the first message is processed then creating and starting the producer may take a little time and prolong the total processing time of the processing. | false | false | MEDIUM
| *camel.sink.endpoint.synchronous* | Sets whether synchronous processing should be strictly used, or Camel is allowed to use asynchronous processing (if supported). | false | false | MEDIUM
| *camel.component.wordpress.apiVersion* | The Wordpress REST API version | "2" | false | MEDIUM
| *camel.component.wordpress.configuration* | Wordpress configuration | null | false | MEDIUM
| *camel.component.wordpress.criteria* | The criteria to use with complex searches. | null | false | MEDIUM
| *camel.component.wordpress.force* | Whether to bypass trash and force deletion. | false | false | MEDIUM
| *camel.component.wordpress.id* | The entity ID. Should be passed when the operation performed requires a specific entity, e.g. deleting a post | null | false | MEDIUM
| *camel.component.wordpress.password* | Password from authorized user | null | false | MEDIUM
| *camel.component.wordpress.searchCriteria* | Search criteria | null | false | MEDIUM
| *camel.component.wordpress.url* | The Wordpress API URL from your site, e.g. \http://myblog.com/wp-json/ | null | true | HIGH
| *camel.component.wordpress.user* | Authorized user to perform writing operations | null | false | MEDIUM
| *camel.component.wordpress.lazyStartProducer* | Whether the producer should be started lazy (on the first message). By starting lazy you can use this to allow CamelContext and routes to startup in situations where a producer may otherwise fail during starting and cause the route to fail being started. By deferring this startup to be lazy then the startup failure can be handled during routing messages via Camel's routing error handlers. Beware that when the first message is processed then creating and starting the producer may take a little time and prolong the total processing time of the processing. | false | false | MEDIUM
| *camel.component.wordpress.autowiredEnabled* | Whether autowiring is enabled. This is used for automatic autowiring options (the option must be marked as autowired) by looking up in the registry to find if there is a single instance of matching type, which then gets configured on the component. This can be used for automatic configuring JDBC data sources, JMS connection factories, AWS Clients, etc. | true | false | MEDIUM
