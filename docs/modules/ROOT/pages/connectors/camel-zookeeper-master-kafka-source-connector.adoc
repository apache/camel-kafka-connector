| Name | Description | Default | Priority
| *camel.source.path.groupName* | The name of the cluster group to use | null | HIGH
| *camel.source.path.consumerEndpointUri* | The consumer endpoint to use in master/slave mode | null | HIGH
| *camel.source.endpoint.bridgeErrorHandler* | Allows for bridging the consumer to the Camel routing Error Handler, which mean any exceptions occurred while the consumer is trying to pickup incoming messages, or the likes, will now be processed as a message and handled by the routing Error Handler. By default the consumer will use the org.apache.camel.spi.ExceptionHandler to deal with exceptions, that will be logged at WARN or ERROR level and ignored. | false | MEDIUM
| *camel.source.endpoint.exceptionHandler* | To let the consumer use a custom ExceptionHandler. Notice if the option bridgeErrorHandler is enabled then this option is not in use. By default the consumer will deal with exceptions, that will be logged at WARN or ERROR level and ignored. | null | MEDIUM
| *camel.source.endpoint.exchangePattern* | Sets the exchange pattern when the consumer creates an exchange. One of: [InOnly] [InOut] [InOptionalOut] | null | MEDIUM
| *camel.source.endpoint.basicPropertyBinding* | Whether the endpoint should use basic property binding (Camel 2.x) or the newer property binding with additional capabilities | false | MEDIUM
| *camel.source.endpoint.synchronous* | Sets whether synchronous processing should be strictly used, or Camel is allowed to use asynchronous processing (if supported). | false | MEDIUM
| *camel.component.zookeeper-master.bridgeError Handler* | Allows for bridging the consumer to the Camel routing Error Handler, which mean any exceptions occurred while the consumer is trying to pickup incoming messages, or the likes, will now be processed as a message and handled by the routing Error Handler. By default the consumer will use the org.apache.camel.spi.ExceptionHandler to deal with exceptions, that will be logged at WARN or ERROR level and ignored. | false | MEDIUM
| *camel.component.zookeeper-master.maximumConnection Timeout* | Timeout in millis to use when connecting to the zookeeper ensemble | 10000 | MEDIUM
| *camel.component.zookeeper-master.zkRoot* | The root path to use in zookeeper where information is stored which nodes are master/slave etc. Will by default use: /camel/zookeepermaster/clusters/master | "/camel/zookeepermaster/clusters/master" | MEDIUM
| *camel.component.zookeeper-master.zooKeeperUrl* | The url for the zookeeper ensemble | "localhost:2181" | MEDIUM
| *camel.component.zookeeper-master.basicProperty Binding* | Whether the component should use basic property binding (Camel 2.x) or the newer property binding with additional capabilities | false | LOW
| *camel.component.zookeeper-master.containerId Factory* | To use a custom ContainerIdFactory for creating container ids. | null | MEDIUM
| *camel.component.zookeeper-master.curator* | To use a custom configured CuratorFramework as connection to zookeeper ensemble. | null | MEDIUM
