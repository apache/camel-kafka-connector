| *camel.source.path.destinationName* | Destination Name | null | HIGH
| *camel.source.endpoint.ackMode* | AUTO = exchange gets ack'ed/nack'ed on completion. NONE = downstream process has to ack/nack explicitly One of: [AUTO] [NONE] | "AUTO" | MEDIUM

| *camel.source.endpoint.synchronousPull* | Synchronously pull batches of messages | false | MEDIUM
| *camel.source.endpoint.bridgeErrorHandler* | Allows for bridging the consumer to the Camel routing Error Handler, which mean any exceptions occurred while the consumer is trying to pickup incoming messages, or the likes, will now be processed as a message and handled by the routing Error Handler. By default the consumer will use the org.apache.camel.spi.ExceptionHandler to deal with exceptions, that will be logged at WARN or ERROR level and ignored. | false | MEDIUM
| *camel.source.endpoint.exceptionHandler* | To let the consumer use a custom ExceptionHandler. Notice if the option bridgeErrorHandler is enabled then this option is not in use. By default the consumer will deal with exceptions, that will be logged at WARN or ERROR level and ignored. | null | MEDIUM

| *camel.component.google-pubsub.endpoint* | Endpoint to use with local Pub/Sub emulator. | null | MEDIUM
| *camel.component.google-pubsub.bridgeErrorHandler* | Allows for bridging the consumer to the Camel routing Error Handler, which mean any exceptions occurred while the consumer is trying to pickup incoming messages, or the likes, will now be processed as a message and handled by the routing Error Handler.
