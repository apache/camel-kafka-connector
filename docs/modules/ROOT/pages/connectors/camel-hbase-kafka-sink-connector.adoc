= camel-hbase-kafka-connector sink configuration

When using camel-hbase-kafka-connector as sink make sure to use the following Maven dependency to have support for the connector:

[source,xml]
----
<dependency>
  <groupId>org.apache.camel.kafkaconnector</groupId>
  <artifactId>camel-hbase-kafka-connector</artifactId>
  <version>x.x.x</version>
  <!-- use the same version as your Camel Kafka connector version -->
</dependency>
----

To use this Sink connector in Kafka connect you'll need to set the following connector.class

[source,java]
----
connector.class=org.apache.camel.kafkaconnector.hbase.CamelHbaseSinkConnector
----


The camel-hbase sink connector supports 16 options, which are listed below.



[width="100%",cols="2,5,^1,2",options="header"]
|===
| Name | Description | Default | Priority
| *camel.sink.path.tableName* | The name of the table | null | HIGH
| *camel.sink.endpoint.cellMappingStrategyFactory* | To use a custom CellMappingStrategyFactory that is responsible for mapping cells. | null | MEDIUM
| *camel.sink.endpoint.filters* | A list of filters to use. | null | MEDIUM
| *camel.sink.endpoint.mappingStrategyClassName* | The class name of a custom mapping strategy implementation. | null | MEDIUM
| *camel.sink.endpoint.mappingStrategyName* | The strategy to use for mapping Camel messages to HBase columns. Supported values: header, or body. One of: [header] [body] | null | MEDIUM
| *camel.sink.endpoint.rowMapping* | To map the key/values from the Map to a HBaseRow. The following keys is supported: rowId - The id of the row. This has limited use as the row usually changes per Exchange. rowType - The type to covert row id to. Supported operations: CamelHBaseScan. family - The column family. Supports a number suffix for referring to more than one columns. qualifier - The column qualifier. Supports a number suffix for referring to more than one columns. value - The value. Supports a number suffix for referring to more than one columns valueType - The value type. Supports a number suffix for referring to more than one columns. Supported operations: CamelHBaseGet, and CamelHBaseScan. | null | MEDIUM
| *camel.sink.endpoint.rowModel* | An instance of org.apache.camel.component.hbase.model.HBaseRow which describes how each row should be modeled | null | MEDIUM
| *camel.sink.endpoint.userGroupInformation* | Defines privileges to communicate with HBase such as using kerberos. | null | MEDIUM
| *camel.sink.endpoint.lazyStartProducer* | Whether the producer should be started lazy (on the first message). By starting lazy you can use this to allow CamelContext and routes to startup in situations where a producer may otherwise fail during starting and cause the route to fail being started. By deferring this startup to be lazy then the startup failure can be handled during routing messages via Camel's routing error handlers. Beware that when the first message is processed then creating and starting the producer may take a little time and prolong the total processing time of the processing. | false | MEDIUM
| *camel.sink.endpoint.maxResults* | The maximum number of rows to scan. | 100 | MEDIUM
| *camel.sink.endpoint.basicPropertyBinding* | Whether the endpoint should use basic property binding (Camel 2.x) or the newer property binding with additional capabilities | false | MEDIUM
| *camel.sink.endpoint.synchronous* | Sets whether synchronous processing should be strictly used, or Camel is allowed to use asynchronous processing (if supported). | false | MEDIUM
| *camel.component.hbase.poolMaxSize* | Maximum number of references to keep for each table in the HTable pool. The default value is 10. | 10 | MEDIUM
| *camel.component.hbase.lazyStartProducer* | Whether the producer should be started lazy (on the first message). By starting lazy you can use this to allow CamelContext and routes to startup in situations where a producer may otherwise fail during starting and cause the route to fail being started. By deferring this startup to be lazy then the startup failure can be handled during routing messages via Camel's routing error handlers. Beware that when the first message is processed then creating and starting the producer may take a little time and prolong the total processing time of the processing. | false | MEDIUM
| *camel.component.hbase.basicPropertyBinding* | Whether the component should use basic property binding (Camel 2.x) or the newer property binding with additional capabilities | false | LOW
| *camel.component.hbase.configuration* | To use the shared configuration | null | MEDIUM
