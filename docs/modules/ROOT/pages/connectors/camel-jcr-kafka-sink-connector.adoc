= camel-jcr-kafka-connector sink configuration

When using camel-jcr-kafka-connector as sink make sure to use the following Maven dependency to have support for the connector:

[source,xml]
----
<dependency>
  <groupId>org.apache.camel.kafkaconnector</groupId>
  <artifactId>camel-jcr-kafka-connector</artifactId>
  <version>x.x.x</version>
  <!-- use the same version as your Camel Kafka connector version -->
</dependency>
----

To use this Sink connector in Kafka connect you'll need to set the following connector.class

[source,java]
----
connector.class=org.apache.camel.kafkaconnector.jcr.CamelJcrSinkConnector
----


The camel-jcr sink connector supports 17 options, which are listed below.



[width="100%",cols="2,5,^1,2",options="header"]
|===
| Name | Description | Default | Priority
| *camel.sink.path.host* | Name of the javax.jcr.Repository to lookup from the Camel registry to be used. | null | HIGH
| *camel.sink.path.base* | Get the base node when accessing the repository | null | MEDIUM
| *camel.sink.endpoint.deep* | When isDeep is true, events whose associated parent node is at absPath or within its subgraph are received. | false | MEDIUM
| *camel.sink.endpoint.eventTypes* | eventTypes (a combination of one or more event types encoded as a bit mask value such as javax.jcr.observation.Event.NODE_ADDED, javax.jcr.observation.Event.NODE_REMOVED, etc.). | null | MEDIUM
| *camel.sink.endpoint.nodeTypeNames* | When a comma separated nodeTypeName list string is set, only events whose associated parent node has one of the node types (or a subtype of one of the node types) in this list will be received. | null | MEDIUM
| *camel.sink.endpoint.noLocal* | If noLocal is true, then events generated by the session through which the listener was registered are ignored. Otherwise, they are not ignored. | false | MEDIUM
| *camel.sink.endpoint.password* | Password for login | null | MEDIUM
| *camel.sink.endpoint.sessionLiveCheckInterval* | Interval in milliseconds to wait before each session live checking The default value is 60000 ms. | 60000L | MEDIUM
| *camel.sink.endpoint.sessionLiveCheckIntervalOn Start* | Interval in milliseconds to wait before the first session live checking. The default value is 3000 ms. | 3000L | MEDIUM
| *camel.sink.endpoint.username* | Username for login | null | MEDIUM
| *camel.sink.endpoint.uuids* | When a comma separated uuid list string is set, only events whose associated parent node has one of the identifiers in the comma separated uuid list will be received. | null | MEDIUM
| *camel.sink.endpoint.workspaceName* | The workspace to access. If it's not specified then the default one will be used | null | MEDIUM
| *camel.sink.endpoint.lazyStartProducer* | Whether the producer should be started lazy (on the first message). By starting lazy you can use this to allow CamelContext and routes to startup in situations where a producer may otherwise fail during starting and cause the route to fail being started. By deferring this startup to be lazy then the startup failure can be handled during routing messages via Camel's routing error handlers. Beware that when the first message is processed then creating and starting the producer may take a little time and prolong the total processing time of the processing. | false | MEDIUM
| *camel.sink.endpoint.basicPropertyBinding* | Whether the endpoint should use basic property binding (Camel 2.x) or the newer property binding with additional capabilities | false | MEDIUM
| *camel.sink.endpoint.synchronous* | Sets whether synchronous processing should be strictly used, or Camel is allowed to use asynchronous processing (if supported). | false | MEDIUM
| *camel.component.jcr.lazyStartProducer* | Whether the producer should be started lazy (on the first message). By starting lazy you can use this to allow CamelContext and routes to startup in situations where a producer may otherwise fail during starting and cause the route to fail being started. By deferring this startup to be lazy then the startup failure can be handled during routing messages via Camel's routing error handlers. Beware that when the first message is processed then creating and starting the producer may take a little time and prolong the total processing time of the processing. | false | MEDIUM
| *camel.component.jcr.basicPropertyBinding* | Whether the component should use basic property binding (Camel 2.x) or the newer property binding with additional capabilities | false | LOW
