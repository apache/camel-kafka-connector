= camel-flink-kafka-connector sink configuration

When using camel-flink-kafka-connector as sink make sure to use the following Maven dependency to have support for the connector:

[source,xml]
----
<dependency>
  <groupId>org.apache.camel.kafkaconnector</groupId>
  <artifactId>camel-flink-kafka-connector</artifactId>
  <version>x.x.x</version>
  <!-- use the same version as your Camel Kafka connector version -->
</dependency>
----


The camel-flink sink connector supports 14 options, which are listed below.

|===
| Name | Description | Default | Priority
| *camel.sink.path.endpointType* | Type of the endpoint (dataset, datastream). One of: [dataset] [datastream] | null | HIGH
| *camel.sink.endpoint.collect* | Indicates if results should be collected or counted. | true | MEDIUM
| *camel.sink.endpoint.dataSet* | DataSet to compute against. | null | MEDIUM
| *camel.sink.endpoint.dataSetCallback* | Function performing action against a DataSet. | null | MEDIUM
| *camel.sink.endpoint.dataStream* | DataStream to compute against. | null | MEDIUM
| *camel.sink.endpoint.dataStreamCallback* | Function performing action against a DataStream. | null | MEDIUM
| *camel.sink.endpoint.lazyStartProducer* | Whether the producer should be started lazy (on the first message). By starting lazy you can use this to allow CamelContext and routes to startup in situations where a producer may otherwise fail during starting and cause the route to fail being started. By deferring this startup to be lazy then the startup failure can be handled during routing messages via Camel's routing error handlers. Beware that when the first message is processed then creating and starting the producer may take a little time and prolong the total processing time of the processing. | false | MEDIUM
| *camel.sink.endpoint.basicPropertyBinding* | Whether the endpoint should use basic property binding (Camel 2.x) or the newer property binding with additional capabilities | false | MEDIUM
| *camel.sink.endpoint.synchronous* | Sets whether synchronous processing should be strictly used, or Camel is allowed to use asynchronous processing (if supported). | false | MEDIUM
| *camel.component.flink.dataSetCallback* | Function performing action against a DataSet. | null | MEDIUM
| *camel.component.flink.dataStream* | DataStream to compute against. | null | MEDIUM
| *camel.component.flink.dataStreamCallback* | Function performing action against a DataStream. | null | MEDIUM
| *camel.component.flink.lazyStartProducer* | Whether the producer should be started lazy (on the first message). By starting lazy you can use this to allow CamelContext and routes to startup in situations where a producer may otherwise fail during starting and cause the route to fail being started.
