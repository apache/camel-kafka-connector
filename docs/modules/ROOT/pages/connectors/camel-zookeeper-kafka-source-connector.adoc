= camel-zookeeper-kafka-connector source configuration

When using camel-zookeeper-kafka-connector as source make sure to use the following Maven dependency to have support for the connector:

[source,xml]
----
<dependency>
  <groupId>org.apache.camel.kafkaconnector</groupId>
  <artifactId>camel-zookeeper-kafka-connector</artifactId>
  <version>x.x.x</version>
  <!-- use the same version as your Camel Kafka connector version -->
</dependency>
----

To use this Source connector in Kafka connect you'll need to set the following connector.class

[source,java]
----
connector.class=org.apache.camel.kafkaconnector.zookeeper.CamelZookeeperSourceConnector
----


The camel-zookeeper source connector supports 20 options, which are listed below.



[width="100%",cols="2,5,^1,2",options="header"]
|===
| Name | Description | Default | Priority
| *camel.source.path.serverUrls* | The zookeeper server hosts (multiple servers can be separated by comma) | null | HIGH
| *camel.source.path.path* | The node in the ZooKeeper server (aka znode) | null | HIGH
| *camel.source.endpoint.listChildren* | Whether the children of the node should be listed | false | MEDIUM
| *camel.source.endpoint.timeout* | The time interval to wait on connection before timing out. | 5000 | MEDIUM
| *camel.source.endpoint.backoff* | The time interval to backoff for after an error before retrying. | 5000L | MEDIUM
| *camel.source.endpoint.bridgeErrorHandler* | Allows for bridging the consumer to the Camel routing Error Handler, which mean any exceptions occurred while the consumer is trying to pickup incoming messages, or the likes, will now be processed as a message and handled by the routing Error Handler. By default the consumer will use the org.apache.camel.spi.ExceptionHandler to deal with exceptions, that will be logged at WARN or ERROR level and ignored. | false | MEDIUM
| *camel.source.endpoint.repeat* | Should changes to the znode be 'watched' and repeatedly processed. | false | MEDIUM
| *camel.source.endpoint.sendEmptyMessageOnDelete* | Upon the delete of a znode, should an empty message be send to the consumer | true | MEDIUM
| *camel.source.endpoint.exceptionHandler* | To let the consumer use a custom ExceptionHandler. Notice if the option bridgeErrorHandler is enabled then this option is not in use. By default the consumer will deal with exceptions, that will be logged at WARN or ERROR level and ignored. | null | MEDIUM
| *camel.source.endpoint.exchangePattern* | Sets the exchange pattern when the consumer creates an exchange. One of: [InOnly] [InOut] [InOptionalOut] | null | MEDIUM
| *camel.source.endpoint.basicPropertyBinding* | Whether the endpoint should use basic property binding (Camel 2.x) or the newer property binding with additional capabilities | false | MEDIUM
| *camel.source.endpoint.synchronous* | Sets whether synchronous processing should be strictly used, or Camel is allowed to use asynchronous processing (if supported). | false | MEDIUM
| *camel.component.zookeeper.listChildren* | Whether the children of the node should be listed | false | MEDIUM
| *camel.component.zookeeper.timeout* | The time interval to wait on connection before timing out. | 5000 | MEDIUM
| *camel.component.zookeeper.backoff* | The time interval to backoff for after an error before retrying. | 5000L | MEDIUM
| *camel.component.zookeeper.bridgeErrorHandler* | Allows for bridging the consumer to the Camel routing Error Handler, which mean any exceptions occurred while the consumer is trying to pickup incoming messages, or the likes, will now be processed as a message and handled by the routing Error Handler.

| *camel.component.zookeeper.sendEmptyMessageOnDelete* | Upon the delete of a znode, should an empty message be send to the consumer | true | MEDIUM
| *camel.component.zookeeper.basicPropertyBinding* | Whether the component should use basic property binding (Camel 2.x) or the newer property binding with additional capabilities | false | LOW
| *camel.component.zookeeper.configuration* | To use a shared ZooKeeperConfiguration | null | MEDIUM
