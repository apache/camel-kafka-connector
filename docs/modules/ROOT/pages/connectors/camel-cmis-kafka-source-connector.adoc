By default the consumer will deal with exceptions, that will be logged at WARN or ERROR level and ignored. | null | MEDIUM

By default the consumer will use the org.apache.camel.spi.ExceptionHandler to deal with exceptions, that will be logged at WARN or ERROR level and ignored. | false | MEDIUM
| *camel.component.cmis.basicPropertyBinding* | Whether the component should use basic property binding (Camel 2.x) or the newer property binding with additional capabilities | false | LOW
| *camel.component.cmis.sessionFacadeFactory* | To use a custom CMISSessionFacadeFactory to create the CMISSessionFacade instances | null | MEDIUM
