= camel-salesforce-kafka-connector sink configuration

When using camel-salesforce-kafka-connector as sink make sure to use the following Maven dependency to have support for the connector:

[source,xml]
----
<dependency>
  <groupId>org.apache.camel.kafkaconnector</groupId>
  <artifactId>camel-salesforce-kafka-connector</artifactId>
  <version>x.x.x</version>
  <!-- use the same version as your Camel Kafka connector version -->

Salesforce component can auto-determine the authentication method to use from the properties set, set this property to eliminate any ambiguity. One of: [USERNAME_PASSWORD] [REFRESH_TOKEN] [JWT] | null | MEDIUM

Make sure that you append security token to the end of the password if using one. | null | MEDIUM

One needs to setup a web application and configure a callback URL to receive the refresh token, or configure using the builtin callback at \https://login.salesforce.com/services/oauth2/success or \https://test.salesforce.com/services/oauth2/success and then retrive the refresh_token from the URL at the end of the flow.
