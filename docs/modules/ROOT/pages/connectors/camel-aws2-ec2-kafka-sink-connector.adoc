Connector Description: Manage AWS EC2 instances using AWS SDK version 2.x.

When using camel-aws2-ec2-kafka-connector as sink make sure to use the following Maven dependency to have support for the connector:

[source,xml]
----
<dependency>
  <groupId>org.apache.camel.kafkaconnector</groupId>
  <artifactId>camel-aws2-ec2-kafka-connector</artifactId>
  <version>x.x.x</version>
  <!-- use the same version as your Camel Kafka connector version -->
</dependency>
----

To use this Sink connector in Kafka connect you'll need to set the following connector.class

[source,java]
----
connector.class=org.apache.camel.kafkaconnector.aws2ec2.CamelAws2ec2SinkConnector
----

|===
| Name | Description | Default | Required | Priority
| *camel.sink.path.label* | Logical name | null | true | HIGH
| *camel.sink.endpoint.accessKey* | Amazon AWS Access Key | null | false | MEDIUM
| *camel.sink.endpoint.amazonEc2Client* | To use a existing configured AmazonEC2Client as client | null | false | MEDIUM
| *camel.sink.endpoint.lazyStartProducer* | Whether the producer should be started lazy (on the first message). By starting lazy you can use this to allow CamelContext and routes to startup in situations where a producer may otherwise fail during starting and cause the route to fail being started. By deferring this startup to be lazy then the startup failure can be handled during routing messages via Camel's routing error handlers. Beware that when the first message is processed then creating and starting the producer may take a little time and prolong the total processing time of the processing. | false | false | MEDIUM
| *camel.sink.endpoint.operation* | The operation to perform. It can be createAndRunInstances, startInstances, stopInstances, terminateInstances, describeInstances, describeInstancesStatus, rebootInstances, monitorInstances, unmonitorInstances, createTags or deleteTags One of: [createAndRunInstances] [startInstances] [stopInstances] [terminateInstances] [describeInstances] [describeInstancesStatus] [rebootInstances] [monitorInstances] [unmonitorInstances] [createTags] [deleteTags] | null | true | HIGH
| *camel.sink.endpoint.overrideEndpoint* | Set the need for overidding the endpoint. This option needs to be used in combination with uriEndpointOverride option | false | false | MEDIUM
| *camel.sink.endpoint.pojoRequest* | If we want to use a POJO request as body or not | false | false | MEDIUM
| *camel.sink.endpoint.proxyHost* | To define a proxy host when instantiating the EC2 client | null | false | MEDIUM
| *camel.sink.endpoint.proxyPort* | To define a proxy port when instantiating the EC2 client | null | false | MEDIUM
| *camel.sink.endpoint.proxyProtocol* | To define a proxy protocol when instantiating the EC2 client One of: [HTTP] [HTTPS] | "HTTPS" | false | MEDIUM
| *camel.sink.endpoint.region* | The region in which EC2 client needs to work. When using this parameter, the configuration will expect the lowercase name of the region (for example ap-east-1) You'll need to use the name Region.EU_WEST_1.id() | null | false | MEDIUM
| *camel.sink.endpoint.secretKey* | Amazon AWS Secret Key | null | false | MEDIUM
| *camel.sink.endpoint.trustAllCertificates* | If we want to trust all certificates in case of overriding the endpoint | false | false | MEDIUM
| *camel.sink.endpoint.uriEndpointOverride* | Set the overriding uri endpoint. This option needs to be used in combination with overrideEndpoint option | null | false | MEDIUM
| *camel.sink.endpoint.useDefaultCredentialsProvider* | Set whether the EC2 client should expect to load credentials through a default credentials provider or to expect static credentials to be passed in. | false | false | MEDIUM
| *camel.component.aws2-ec2.accessKey* | Amazon AWS Access Key | null | false | MEDIUM
| *camel.component.aws2-ec2.amazonEc2Client* | To use a existing configured AmazonEC2Client as client | null | false | MEDIUM
| *camel.component.aws2-ec2.configuration* | The component configuration | null | false | MEDIUM
| *camel.component.aws2-ec2.lazyStartProducer* | Whether the producer should be started lazy (on the first message).

| *camel.component.aws2-ec2.useDefaultCredentials Provider* | Set whether the EC2 client should expect to load credentials through a default credentials provider or to expect static credentials to be passed in. | false | false | MEDIUM
| *camel.component.aws2-ec2.autowiredEnabled* | Whether autowiring is enabled. This is used for automatic autowiring options (the option must be marked as autowired) by looking up in the registry to find if there is a single instance of matching type, which then gets configured on the component. This can be used for automatic configuring JDBC data sources, JMS connection factories, AWS Clients, etc. | true | false | MEDIUM
