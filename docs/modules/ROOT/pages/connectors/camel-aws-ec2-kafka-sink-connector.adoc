Connector Description: Manage AWS EC2 instances.

When using camel-aws-ec2-kafka-connector as sink make sure to use the following Maven dependency to have support for the connector:

[source,xml]
----
<dependency>
  <groupId>org.apache.camel.kafkaconnector</groupId>
  <artifactId>camel-aws-ec2-kafka-connector</artifactId>
  <version>x.x.x</version>
  <!-- use the same version as your Camel Kafka connector version -->
</dependency>
----

To use this Sink connector in Kafka connect you'll need to set the following connector.class

[source,java]
----
connector.class=org.apache.camel.kafkaconnector.awsec2.CamelAwsec2SinkConnector
----


The camel-aws-ec2 sink connector supports 24 options, which are listed below.

|===
| Name | Description | Default | Required | Priority
| *camel.sink.path.label* | Logical name | null | true | HIGH
| *camel.sink.endpoint.autoDiscoverClient* | Setting the autoDiscoverClient mechanism, if true, the component will look for a client instance in the registry automatically otherwise it will skip that checking. | true | false | MEDIUM
| *camel.sink.endpoint.accessKey* | Amazon AWS Access Key | null | false | MEDIUM
| *camel.sink.endpoint.amazonEc2Client* | To use a existing configured AmazonEC2Client as client | null | false | MEDIUM
| *camel.sink.endpoint.lazyStartProducer* | Whether the producer should be started lazy (on the first message). By starting lazy you can use this to allow CamelContext and routes to startup in situations where a producer may otherwise fail during starting and cause the route to fail being started. By deferring this startup to be lazy then the startup failure can be handled during routing messages via Camel's routing error handlers. Beware that when the first message is processed then creating and starting the producer may take a little time and prolong the total processing time of the processing. | false | false | MEDIUM
| *camel.sink.endpoint.operation* | The operation to perform. It can be createAndRunInstances, startInstances, stopInstances, terminateInstances, describeInstances, describeInstancesStatus, rebootInstances, monitorInstances, unmonitorInstances, createTags or deleteTags One of: [createAndRunInstances] [startInstances] [stopInstances] [terminateInstances] [describeInstances] [describeInstancesStatus] [rebootInstances] [monitorInstances] [unmonitorInstances] [createTags] [deleteTags] | null | true | HIGH
| *camel.sink.endpoint.proxyHost* | To define a proxy host when instantiating the EC2 client | null | false | MEDIUM
| *camel.sink.endpoint.proxyPort* | To define a proxy port when instantiating the EC2 client | null | false | MEDIUM
| *camel.sink.endpoint.proxyProtocol* | To define a proxy protocol when instantiating the EC2 client One of: [HTTP] [HTTPS] | "HTTPS" | false | MEDIUM
| *camel.sink.endpoint.region* | The region in which ECS client needs to work. When using this parameter, the configuration will expect the lowercase name of the region (for example ap-east-1) You'll need to use the name Region.EU_WEST_1.id() | null | false | MEDIUM
| *camel.sink.endpoint.secretKey* | Amazon AWS Secret Key | null | false | MEDIUM
| *camel.sink.endpoint.synchronous* | Sets whether synchronous processing should be strictly used, or Camel is allowed to use asynchronous processing (if supported). | false | false | MEDIUM
| *camel.component.aws-ec2.autoDiscoverClient* | Setting the autoDiscoverClient mechanism, if true, the component will look for a client instance in the registry automatically otherwise it will skip that checking. | true | false | MEDIUM
| *camel.component.aws-ec2.accessKey* | Amazon AWS Access Key | null | false | MEDIUM
| *camel.component.aws-ec2.amazonEc2Client* | To use a existing configured AmazonEC2Client as client | null | false | MEDIUM
| *camel.component.aws-ec2.configuration* | The component configuration | null | false | MEDIUM
| *camel.component.aws-ec2.lazyStartProducer* | Whether the producer should be started lazy (on the first message). By starting lazy you can use this to allow CamelContext and routes to startup in situations where a producer may otherwise fail during starting and cause the route to fail being started. By deferring this startup to be lazy then the startup failure can be handled during routing messages via Camel's routing error handlers. Beware that when the first message is processed then creating and starting the producer may take a little time and prolong the total processing time of the processing. | false | false | MEDIUM

| *camel.component.aws-ec2.proxyProtocol* | To define a proxy protocol when instantiating the EC2 client One of: [HTTP] [HTTPS] | "HTTPS" | false | MEDIUM
| *camel.component.aws-ec2.region* | The region in which ECS client needs to work. When using this parameter, the configuration will expect the lowercase name of the region (for example ap-east-1) You'll need to use the name Region.EU_WEST_1.id() | null | false | MEDIUM
| *camel.component.aws-ec2.secretKey* | Amazon AWS Secret Key | null | false | MEDIUM
| *camel.component.aws-ec2.autowiredEnabled* | Whether autowiring is enabled. This is used for automatic autowiring options (the option must be marked as autowired) by looking up in the registry to find if there is a single instance of matching type, which then gets configured on the component. This can be used for automatic configuring JDBC data sources, JMS connection factories, AWS Clients, etc. | true | false | MEDIUM
