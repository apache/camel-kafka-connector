| *camel.source.endpoint.eventTypes* | eventTypes (a combination of one or more event types encoded as a bit mask value such as javax.jcr.observation.Event.NODE_ADDED, javax.jcr.observation.Event.NODE_REMOVED, etc.). | null | MEDIUM
| *camel.source.endpoint.nodeTypeNames* | When a comma separated nodeTypeName list string is set, only events whose associated parent node has one of the node types (or a subtype of one of the node types) in this list will be received. | null | MEDIUM
| *camel.source.endpoint.noLocal* | If noLocal is true, then events generated by the session through which the listener was registered are ignored. Otherwise, they are not ignored. | false | MEDIUM
| *camel.source.endpoint.password* | Password for login | null | MEDIUM
| *camel.source.endpoint.sessionLiveCheckInterval* | Interval in milliseconds to wait before each session live checking The default value is 60000 ms. | 60000L | MEDIUM

By default the consumer will use the org.apache.camel.spi.ExceptionHandler to deal with exceptions, that will be logged at WARN or ERROR level and ignored. | false | MEDIUM
| *camel.source.endpoint.exceptionHandler* | To let the consumer use a custom ExceptionHandler. Notice if the option bridgeErrorHandler is enabled then this option is not in use. By default the consumer will deal with exceptions, that will be logged at WARN or ERROR level and ignored. | null | MEDIUM
| *camel.source.endpoint.exchangePattern* | Sets the exchange pattern when the consumer creates an exchange. One of: [InOnly] [InOut] [InOptionalOut] | null | MEDIUM
| *camel.source.endpoint.basicPropertyBinding* | Whether the endpoint should use basic property binding (Camel 2.x) or the newer property binding with additional capabilities | false | MEDIUM
| *camel.source.endpoint.synchronous* | Sets whether synchronous processing should be strictly used, or Camel is allowed to use asynchronous processing (if supported). | false | MEDIUM
| *camel.component.jcr.bridgeErrorHandler* | Allows for bridging the consumer to the Camel routing Error Handler, which mean any exceptions occurred while the consumer is trying to pickup incoming messages, or the likes, will now be processed as a message and handled by the routing Error Handler. By default the consumer will use the org.apache.camel.spi.ExceptionHandler to deal with exceptions, that will be logged at WARN or ERROR level and ignored. | false | MEDIUM
