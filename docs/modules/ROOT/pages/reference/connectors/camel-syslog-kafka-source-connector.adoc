[[camel-syslog-kafka-connector-source]]
= camel-syslog-kafka-connector source configuration

When using camel-syslog-kafka-connector as source make sure to use the following Maven dependency to have support for the connector:

[source,xml]
----
<dependency>
  <groupId>org.apache.camel.kafkaconnector</groupId>
  <artifactId>camel-syslog-kafka-connector</artifactId>
  <version>x.x.x</version>
  <!-- use the same version as your Camel Kafka connector version -->
</dependency>
----


The camel-syslog source connector supports is based on camel-netty source connector and supports all its options (see: xref:connectors/camel-netty-kafka-source-connector.adoc[Netty Source Docs]);
however has been already preconfigured and should be sufficient to provide the following properties:
[width="100%",cols="2,5,^1,2",options="header"]
