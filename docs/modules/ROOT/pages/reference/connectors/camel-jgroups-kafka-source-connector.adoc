[width="100%",cols="2,5,^1,1,1",options="header"]
|===
| Name | Description | Default | Required | Priority
| *camel.source.path.clusterName* | The name of the JGroups cluster the component should connect to. | null | true | HIGH
| *camel.source.endpoint.channelProperties* | Specifies configuration properties of the JChannel used by the endpoint. | null | false | MEDIUM
| *camel.source.endpoint.bridgeErrorHandler* | Allows for bridging the consumer to the Camel routing Error Handler, which mean any exceptions occurred while the consumer is trying to pickup incoming messages, or the likes, will now be processed as a message and handled by the routing Error Handler. By default the consumer will use the org.apache.camel.spi.ExceptionHandler to deal with exceptions, that will be logged at WARN or ERROR level and ignored. | false | false | MEDIUM
| *camel.source.endpoint.enableViewMessages* | If set to true, the consumer endpoint will receive org.jgroups.View messages as well (not only org.jgroups.Message instances). By default only regular messages are consumed by the endpoint. | false | false | MEDIUM
| *camel.source.endpoint.exceptionHandler* | To let the consumer use a custom ExceptionHandler. Notice if the option bridgeErrorHandler is enabled then this option is not in use. By default the consumer will deal with exceptions, that will be logged at WARN or ERROR level and ignored. | null | false | MEDIUM
| *camel.source.endpoint.exchangePattern* | Sets the exchange pattern when the consumer creates an exchange. One of: [InOnly] [InOut] [InOptionalOut] | null | false | MEDIUM
| *camel.component.jgroups.channel* | Channel to use | null | false | MEDIUM
| *camel.component.jgroups.channelProperties* | Specifies configuration properties of the JChannel used by the endpoint. | null | false | MEDIUM
| *camel.component.jgroups.bridgeErrorHandler* | Allows for bridging the consumer to the Camel routing Error Handler, which mean any exceptions occurred while the consumer is trying to pickup incoming messages, or the likes, will now be processed as a message and handled by the routing Error Handler. By default the consumer will use the org.apache.camel.spi.ExceptionHandler to deal with exceptions, that will be logged at WARN or ERROR level and ignored. | false | false | MEDIUM
| *camel.component.jgroups.enableViewMessages* | If set to true, the consumer endpoint will receive org.jgroups.View messages as well (not only org.jgroups.Message instances). By default only regular messages are consumed by the endpoint. | false | false | MEDIUM
| *camel.component.jgroups.autowiredEnabled* | Whether autowiring is enabled. This is used for automatic autowiring options (the option must be marked as autowired) by looking up in the registry to find if there is a single instance of matching type, which then gets configured on the component. This can be used for automatic configuring JDBC data sources, JMS connection factories, AWS Clients, etc. | true | false | MEDIUM
