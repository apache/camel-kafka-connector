[width="100%",cols="2,5,^1,1,1",options="header"]
|===
| Name | Description | Default | Required | Priority
| *camel.sink.path.bucketName* | Bucket name | null | true | HIGH
| *camel.sink.endpoint.autoCreateBucket* | Setting the autocreation of the bucket if bucket name not exist. | true | false | MEDIUM
| *camel.sink.endpoint.customHttpClient* | Set custom HTTP client for authenticated access. | null | false | MEDIUM
| *camel.sink.endpoint.endpoint* | Endpoint can be an URL, domain name, IPv4 address or IPv6 address. | null | false | MEDIUM
| *camel.sink.endpoint.minioClient* | Reference to a Minio Client object in the registry. | null | false | MEDIUM
| *camel.sink.endpoint.objectLock* | Set when creating new bucket. | false | false | MEDIUM
| *camel.sink.endpoint.policy* | The policy for this queue to set in the method. | null | false | MEDIUM
| *camel.sink.endpoint.proxyPort* | TCP/IP port number. 80 and 443 are used as defaults for HTTP and HTTPS. | null | false | MEDIUM
| *camel.sink.endpoint.region* | The region in which Minio client needs to work. When using this parameter, the configuration will expect the lowercase name of the region (for example ap-east-1). You'll need to use the name Region.EU_WEST_1.id() | null | false | MEDIUM
| *camel.sink.endpoint.secure* | Flag to indicate to use secure connection to minio service or not. | false | false | MEDIUM
| *camel.sink.endpoint.serverSideEncryption* | Server-side encryption. | null | false | MEDIUM
| *camel.sink.endpoint.serverSideEncryptionCustomer Key* | Server-side encryption for source object while copy/move objects. | null | false | MEDIUM
| *camel.sink.endpoint.deleteAfterWrite* | Delete file object after the Minio file has been uploaded. | false | false | MEDIUM
| *camel.sink.endpoint.keyName* | Setting the key name for an element in the bucket through endpoint parameter. | null | false | MEDIUM
| *camel.sink.endpoint.lazyStartProducer* | Whether the producer should be started lazy (on the first message). By starting lazy you can use this to allow CamelContext and routes to startup in situations where a producer may otherwise fail during starting and cause the route to fail being started. By deferring this startup to be lazy then the startup failure can be handled during routing messages via Camel's routing error handlers. Beware that when the first message is processed then creating and starting the producer may take a little time and prolong the total processing time of the processing. | false | false | MEDIUM
| *camel.sink.endpoint.operation* | The operation to do in case the user don't want to do only an upload. One of: [copyObject] [listObjects] [deleteObject] [deleteObjects] [deleteBucket] [listBuckets] [getObject] [getObjectRange] | null | false | MEDIUM
| *camel.sink.endpoint.pojoRequest* | If we want to use a POJO request as body or not. | false | false | MEDIUM
| *camel.sink.endpoint.storageClass* | The storage class to set in the request. | null | false | MEDIUM
| *camel.sink.endpoint.accessKey* | Amazon AWS Secret Access Key or Minio Access Key. If not set camel will connect to service for anonymous access. | null | false | MEDIUM
| *camel.sink.endpoint.secretKey* | Amazon AWS Access Key Id or Minio Secret Key. If not set camel will connect to service for anonymous access. | null | false | MEDIUM
| *camel.component.minio.autoCreateBucket* | Setting the autocreation of the bucket if bucket name not exist. | true | false | MEDIUM

| *camel.component.minio.autowiredEnabled* | Whether autowiring is enabled. This is used for automatic autowiring options (the option must be marked as autowired) by looking up in the registry to find if there is a single instance of matching type, which then gets configured on the component. This can be used for automatic configuring JDBC data sources, JMS connection factories, AWS Clients, etc. | true | false | MEDIUM
