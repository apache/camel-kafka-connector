| *camel.sink.endpoint.region* | The region in which S3 client needs to work. When using this parameter, the configuration will expect the capitalized name of the region (for example AP_EAST_1) You'll need to use the name Regions.EU_WEST_1.name() | null | false | MEDIUM
| *camel.sink.endpoint.useIAMCredentials* | Set whether the S3 client should expect to load credentials on an EC2 instance or to expect static credentials to be passed in. | false | false | MEDIUM
