Connector description: The azure-eventhubs component that integrates Azure Event Hubs using AMQP protocol. Azure EventHubs is a highly scalable publish-subscribe service that can ingest millions of events per second and stream them to multiple consumers.

When using camel-azure-eventhubs-kafka-connector as source make sure to use the following Maven dependency to have support for the connector:

[source,xml]
----
<dependency>
  <groupId>org.apache.camel.kafkaconnector</groupId>
  <artifactId>camel-azure-eventhubs-kafka-connector</artifactId>
  <version>x.x.x</version>
  <!-- use the same version as your Camel Kafka connector version -->
</dependency>
----

To use this Source connector in Kafka connect you'll need to set the following connector.class

[source,java]
----
connector.class=org.apache.camel.kafkaconnector.azureeventhubs.CamelAzureeventhubsSourceConnector
----


The camel-azure-eventhubs source connector supports 34 options, which are listed below.

|===
| Name | Description | Default | Required | Priority
| *camel.source.path.namespace* | EventHubs namespace created in Azure Portal | null | false | MEDIUM
| *camel.source.path.eventHubName* | EventHubs name under a specific namcespace | null | false | MEDIUM
| *camel.source.endpoint.amqpRetryOptions* | Sets the retry policy for EventHubAsyncClient. If not specified, the default retry options are used. | null | false | MEDIUM
| *camel.source.endpoint.amqpTransportType* | Sets the transport type by which all the communication with Azure Event Hubs occurs. Default value is AmqpTransportType#AMQP. One of: [Amqp] [AmqpWebSockets] | "AMQP" | false | MEDIUM
| *camel.source.endpoint.blobAccessKey* | In case you chose the default BlobCheckpointStore, this sets access key for the associated azure account name to be used for authentication with azure blob services | null | false | MEDIUM
| *camel.source.endpoint.blobAccountName* | In case you chose the default BlobCheckpointStore, this sets Azure account name to be used for authentication with azure blob services. | null | false | MEDIUM
| *camel.source.endpoint.blobContainerName* | In case you chose the default BlobCheckpointStore, this sets the blob container that shall be used by the BlobCheckpointStore to store the checkpoint offsets | null | false | MEDIUM
| *camel.source.endpoint.blobStorageSharedKey Credential* | In case you chose the default BlobCheckpointStore, StorageSharedKeyCredential can be injected to create the azure client, this holds the important authentication information | null | false | MEDIUM
| *camel.source.endpoint.bridgeErrorHandler* | Allows for bridging the consumer to the Camel routing Error Handler, which mean any exceptions occurred while the consumer is trying to pickup incoming messages, or the likes, will now be processed as a message and handled by the routing Error Handler. By default the consumer will use the org.apache.camel.spi.ExceptionHandler to deal with exceptions, that will be logged at WARN or ERROR level and ignored. | false | false | MEDIUM
| *camel.source.endpoint.checkpointStore* | Sets the CheckpointStore the EventProcessorClient will use for storing partition ownership and checkpoint information. Users can, optionally, provide their own implementation of CheckpointStore which will store ownership and checkpoint information. By default it set to use com.azure.messaging.eventhubs.checkpointstore.blob.BlobCheckpointStore which stores all checkpoint offsets into Azure Blob Storage | "BlobCheckpointStore" | false | MEDIUM
| *camel.source.endpoint.consumerGroupName* | Sets the name of the consumer group this consumer is associated with. Events are read in the context of this group. The name of the consumer group that is created by default is {link #DEFAULT_CONSUMER_GROUP_NAME $Default}. | "$Default" | false | MEDIUM
| *camel.source.endpoint.eventPosition* | Sets the map containing the event position to use for each partition if a checkpoint for the partition does not exist in CheckpointStore. This map is keyed off of the partition id. If there is no checkpoint in CheckpointStore and there is no entry in this map, the processing of the partition will start from {link EventPosition#latest() latest} position. | null | false | MEDIUM
| *camel.source.endpoint.prefetchCount* | Sets the count used by the receiver to control the number of events the Event Hub consumer will actively receive and queue locally without regard to whether a receive operation is currently active. | 500 | false | MEDIUM
| *camel.source.endpoint.exceptionHandler* | To let the consumer use a custom ExceptionHandler. Notice if the option bridgeErrorHandler is enabled then this option is not in use. By default the consumer will deal with exceptions, that will be logged at WARN or ERROR level and ignored. | null | false | MEDIUM
| *camel.source.endpoint.exchangePattern* | Sets the exchange pattern when the consumer creates an exchange. One of: [InOnly] [InOut] [InOptionalOut] | null | false | MEDIUM
| *camel.source.endpoint.connectionString* | Instead of supplying namespace, sharedAccessKey, sharedAccessName ... etc, you can just supply the connection string for your eventHub. The connection string for EventHubs already include all the necessary information to connection to your EventHub. To learn on how to generate the connection string, take a look at this documentation: \https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/event-hubs/event-hubs-get-connection-string | null | false | MEDIUM
| *camel.source.endpoint.sharedAccessKey* | The generated value for the SharedAccessName | null | false | MEDIUM
| *camel.source.endpoint.sharedAccessName* | The name you chose for your EventHubs SAS keys | null | false | MEDIUM
| *camel.component.azure-eventhubs.amqpRetryOptions* | Sets the retry policy for EventHubAsyncClient. If not specified, the default retry options are used. | null | false | MEDIUM
| *camel.component.azure-eventhubs.amqpTransportType* | Sets the transport type by which all the communication with Azure Event Hubs occurs. Default value is AmqpTransportType#AMQP. One of: [Amqp] [AmqpWebSockets] | "AMQP" | false | MEDIUM
| *camel.component.azure-eventhubs.configuration* | The component configurations | null | false | MEDIUM
| *camel.component.azure-eventhubs.blobAccessKey* | In case you chose the default BlobCheckpointStore, this sets access key for the associated azure account name to be used for authentication with azure blob services | null | false | MEDIUM
| *camel.component.azure-eventhubs.blobAccountName* | In case you chose the default BlobCheckpointStore, this sets Azure account name to be used for authentication with azure blob services. | null | false | MEDIUM

| *camel.component.azure-eventhubs.autowiredEnabled* | Whether autowiring is enabled. This is used for automatic autowiring options (the option must be marked as autowired) by looking up in the registry to find if there is a single instance of matching type, which then gets configured on the component. This can be used for automatic configuring JDBC data sources, JMS connection factories, AWS Clients, etc. | true | false | MEDIUM
| *camel.component.azure-eventhubs.connectionString* | Instead of supplying namespace, sharedAccessKey, sharedAccessName ... etc, you can just supply the connection string for your eventHub.
