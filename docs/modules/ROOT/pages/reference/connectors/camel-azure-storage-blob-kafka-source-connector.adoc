|===
| Name | Description | Default | Required | Priority
| *camel.source.path.accountName* | Azure account name to be used for authentication with azure blob services | null | false | MEDIUM
| *camel.source.path.containerName* | The blob container name | null | false | MEDIUM
| *camel.source.endpoint.blobName* | The blob name, to consume specific blob from a container. However on producer, is only required for the operations on the blob level | null | false | MEDIUM
| *camel.source.endpoint.blobOffset* | Set the blob offset for the upload or download operations, default is 0 | 0L | false | MEDIUM
| *camel.source.endpoint.blobServiceClient* | Client to a storage account. This client does not hold any state about a particular storage account but is instead a convenient way of sending off appropriate requests to the resource on the service. It may also be used to construct URLs to blobs and containers. This client contains operations on a service account. Operations on a container are available on BlobContainerClient through getBlobContainerClient(String), and operations on a blob are available on BlobClient through getBlobContainerClient(String).getBlobClient(String). | null | false | MEDIUM
| *camel.source.endpoint.blobType* | The blob type in order to initiate the appropriate settings for each blob type One of: [blockblob] [appendblob] [pageblob] | "blockblob" | false | MEDIUM
| *camel.source.endpoint.closeStreamAfterRead* | Close the stream after read or keep it open, default is true | true | false | MEDIUM
| *camel.source.endpoint.credentials* | StorageSharedKeyCredential can be injected to create the azure client, this holds the important authentication information | null | false | MEDIUM
| *camel.source.endpoint.dataCount* | How many bytes to include in the range. Must be greater than or equal to 0 if specified. | null | false | MEDIUM
| *camel.source.endpoint.fileDir* | The file directory where the downloaded blobs will be saved to, this can be used in both, producer and consumer | null | false | MEDIUM
| *camel.source.endpoint.maxResultsPerPage* | Specifies the maximum number of blobs to return, including all BlobPrefix elements. If the request does not specify maxResultsPerPage or specifies a value greater than 5,000, the server will return up to 5,000 items. | null | false | MEDIUM
| *camel.source.endpoint.maxRetryRequests* | Specifies the maximum number of additional HTTP Get requests that will be made while reading the data from a response body. | 0 | false | MEDIUM
| *camel.source.endpoint.prefix* | Filters the results to return only blobs whose names begin with the specified prefix. May be null to return all blobs. | null | false | MEDIUM
| *camel.source.endpoint.regex* | Filters the results to return only blobs whose names match the specified regular expression. May be null to return all if both prefix and regex are set, regex takes the priority and prefix is ignored. | null | false | MEDIUM
| *camel.source.endpoint.serviceClient* | Client to a storage account. This client does not hold any state about a particular storage account but is instead a convenient way of sending off appropriate requests to the resource on the service. It may also be used to construct URLs to blobs and containers. This client contains operations on a service account. Operations on a container are available on BlobContainerClient through BlobServiceClient#getBlobContainerClient(String), and operations on a blob are available on BlobClient through BlobContainerClient#getBlobClient(String). | null | false | MEDIUM
| *camel.source.endpoint.timeout* | An optional timeout value beyond which a RuntimeException will be raised. | null | false | MEDIUM
| *camel.source.endpoint.bridgeErrorHandler* | Allows for bridging the consumer to the Camel routing Error Handler, which mean any exceptions occurred while the consumer is trying to pickup incoming messages, or the likes, will now be processed as a message and handled by the routing Error Handler. By default the consumer will use the org.apache.camel.spi.ExceptionHandler to deal with exceptions, that will be logged at WARN or ERROR level and ignored. | false | false | MEDIUM

By default the consumer will deal with exceptions, that will be logged at WARN or ERROR level and ignored. | null | false | MEDIUM
| *camel.source.endpoint.exchangePattern* | Sets the exchange pattern when the consumer creates an exchange. One of: [InOnly] [InOut] [InOptionalOut] | null | false | MEDIUM
| *camel.source.endpoint.pollStrategy* | A pluggable org.apache.camel.PollingConsumerPollingStrategy allowing you to provide your custom implementation to control error handling usually occurred during the poll operation before an Exchange have been created and being routed in Camel. | null | false | MEDIUM
| *camel.source.endpoint.backoffErrorThreshold* | The number of subsequent error polls (failed due some error) that should happen before the backoffMultipler should kick-in. | null | false | MEDIUM
| *camel.source.endpoint.backoffIdleThreshold* | The number of subsequent idle polls that should happen before the backoffMultipler should kick-in. | null | false | MEDIUM
| *camel.source.endpoint.backoffMultiplier* | To let the scheduled polling consumer backoff if there has been a number of subsequent idles/errors in a row. The multiplier is then the number of polls that will be skipped before the next actual attempt is happening again. When this option is in use then backoffIdleThreshold and/or backoffErrorThreshold must also be configured. | null | false | MEDIUM
| *camel.source.endpoint.delay* | Milliseconds before the next poll. | 500L | false | MEDIUM
| *camel.source.endpoint.greedy* | If greedy is enabled, then the ScheduledPollConsumer will run immediately again, if the previous run polled 1 or more messages. | false | false | MEDIUM
| *camel.source.endpoint.initialDelay* | Milliseconds before the first poll starts. | 1000L | false | MEDIUM
| *camel.source.endpoint.repeatCount* | Specifies a maximum limit of number of fires. So if you set it to 1, the scheduler will only fire once. If you set it to 5, it will only fire five times. A value of zero or negative means fire forever. | 0L | false | MEDIUM
| *camel.source.endpoint.runLoggingLevel* | The consumer logs a start/complete log line when it polls. This option allows you to configure the logging level for that. One of: [TRACE] [DEBUG] [INFO] [WARN] [ERROR] [OFF] | "TRACE" | false | MEDIUM
| *camel.source.endpoint.scheduledExecutorService* | Allows for configuring a custom/shared thread pool to use for the consumer. By default each consumer has its own single threaded thread pool. | null | false | MEDIUM
| *camel.source.endpoint.scheduler* | To use a cron scheduler from either camel-spring or camel-quartz component. Use value spring or quartz for built in scheduler | "none" | false | MEDIUM
| *camel.source.endpoint.schedulerProperties* | To configure additional properties when using a custom scheduler or any of the Quartz, Spring based scheduler. | null | false | MEDIUM

| *camel.source.endpoint.useFixedDelay* | Controls if fixed delay or fixed rate is used. See ScheduledExecutorService in JDK for details. | true | false | MEDIUM
