| *camel.source.endpoint.closeStreamAfterRead* | Close the stream after read or keep it open, default is true | true | false | MEDIUM
| *camel.source.endpoint.credentials* | Set the storage credentials, required in most cases | null | false | MEDIUM
| *camel.source.endpoint.dataLength* | Set the data length for the download or page blob upload operations | null | false | MEDIUM
