Connector Description: Store and retrieve blobs from Azure Storage Blob Service using SDK v12.

When using camel-azure-storage-blob-kafka-connector as sink make sure to use the following Maven dependency to have support for the connector:

[source,xml]
----
<dependency>
  <groupId>org.apache.camel.kafkaconnector</groupId>
  <artifactId>camel-azure-storage-blob-kafka-connector</artifactId>
  <version>x.x.x</version>
  <!-- use the same version as your Camel Kafka connector version -->
</dependency>
----

To use this Sink connector in Kafka connect you'll need to set the following connector.class

[source,java]
----
connector.class=org.apache.camel.kafkaconnector.azurestorageblob.CamelAzurestorageblobSinkConnector
----


The camel-azure-storage-blob sink connector supports 53 options, which are listed below.

|===
| Name | Description | Default | Required | Priority
| *camel.sink.path.accountName* | Azure account name to be used for authentication with azure blob services | null | false | MEDIUM
| *camel.sink.path.containerName* | The blob container name | null | false | MEDIUM
| *camel.sink.endpoint.blobName* | The blob name, to consume specific blob from a container. However on producer, is only required for the operations on the blob level | null | false | MEDIUM
| *camel.sink.endpoint.blobOffset* | Set the blob offset for the upload or download operations, default is 0 | 0L | false | MEDIUM
| *camel.sink.endpoint.blobServiceClient* | Client to a storage account. This client does not hold any state about a particular storage account but is instead a convenient way of sending off appropriate requests to the resource on the service. It may also be used to construct URLs to blobs and containers. This client contains operations on a service account. Operations on a container are available on BlobContainerClient through getBlobContainerClient(String), and operations on a blob are available on BlobClient through getBlobContainerClient(String).getBlobClient(String). | null | false | MEDIUM
| *camel.sink.endpoint.blobType* | The blob type in order to initiate the appropriate settings for each blob type One of: [blockblob] [appendblob] [pageblob] | "blockblob" | false | MEDIUM
| *camel.sink.endpoint.closeStreamAfterRead* | Close the stream after read or keep it open, default is true | true | false | MEDIUM
| *camel.sink.endpoint.credentials* | StorageSharedKeyCredential can be injected to create the azure client, this holds the important authentication information | null | false | MEDIUM
| *camel.sink.endpoint.dataCount* | How many bytes to include in the range. Must be greater than or equal to 0 if specified. | null | false | MEDIUM
| *camel.sink.endpoint.fileDir* | The file directory where the downloaded blobs will be saved to, this can be used in both, producer and consumer | null | false | MEDIUM
| *camel.sink.endpoint.maxResultsPerPage* | Specifies the maximum number of blobs to return, including all BlobPrefix elements. If the request does not specify maxResultsPerPage or specifies a value greater than 5,000, the server will return up to 5,000 items. | null | false | MEDIUM
| *camel.sink.endpoint.maxRetryRequests* | Specifies the maximum number of additional HTTP Get requests that will be made while reading the data from a response body. | 0 | false | MEDIUM
| *camel.sink.endpoint.prefix* | Filters the results to return only blobs whose names begin with the specified prefix. May be null to return all blobs. | null | false | MEDIUM
| *camel.sink.endpoint.regex* | Filters the results to return only blobs whose names match the specified regular expression. May be null to return all if both prefix and regex are set, regex takes the priority and prefix is ignored. | null | false | MEDIUM
| *camel.sink.endpoint.serviceClient* | Client to a storage account. This client does not hold any state about a particular storage account but is instead a convenient way of sending off appropriate requests to the resource on the service. It may also be used to construct URLs to blobs and containers. This client contains operations on a service account. Operations on a container are available on BlobContainerClient through BlobServiceClient#getBlobContainerClient(String), and operations on a blob are available on BlobClient through BlobContainerClient#getBlobClient(String). | null | false | MEDIUM
| *camel.sink.endpoint.timeout* | An optional timeout value beyond which a RuntimeException will be raised. | null | false | MEDIUM
| *camel.sink.endpoint.blobSequenceNumber* | A user-controlled value that you can use to track requests. The value of the sequence number must be between 0 and 263 - 1.The default value is 0. | "0" | false | MEDIUM
| *camel.sink.endpoint.blockListType* | Specifies which type of blocks to return. One of: [committed] [uncommitted] [all] | "COMMITTED" | false | MEDIUM
| *camel.sink.endpoint.closeStreamAfterWrite* | Close the stream after write or keep it open, default is true | true | false | MEDIUM

| *camel.sink.endpoint.createAppendBlob* | When is set to true, the append blocks will be created when committing append blocks. | true | false | MEDIUM
| *camel.sink.endpoint.createPageBlob* | When is set to true, the page blob will be created when uploading page blob. | true | false | MEDIUM
| *camel.sink.endpoint.downloadLinkExpiration* | Override the default expiration (millis) of URL download link. | null | false | MEDIUM
| *camel.sink.endpoint.lazyStartProducer* | Whether the producer should be started lazy (on the first message). By starting lazy you can use this to allow CamelContext and routes to startup in situations where a producer may otherwise fail during starting and cause the route to fail being started. By deferring this startup to be lazy then the startup failure can be handled during routing messages via Camel's routing error handlers. Beware that when the first message is processed then creating and starting the producer may take a little time and prolong the total processing time of the processing. | false | false | MEDIUM
