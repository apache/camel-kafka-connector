Connector Description: Perform operations on ArangoDb when used as a Document Database, or as a Graph Database

When using camel-arangodb-kafka-connector as sink make sure to use the following Maven dependency to have support for the connector:

[source,xml]
----
<dependency>
  <groupId>org.apache.camel.kafkaconnector</groupId>
  <artifactId>camel-arangodb-kafka-connector</artifactId>
  <version>x.x.x</version>
  <!-- use the same version as your Camel Kafka connector version -->
</dependency>
----

To use this Sink connector in Kafka connect you'll need to set the following connector.class

[source,java]
----
connector.class=org.apache.camel.kafkaconnector.arangodb.CamelArangodbSinkConnector
----


The camel-arangodb sink connector supports 23 options, which are listed below.



[width="100%",cols="2,5,^1,1,1",options="header"]
|===
| Name | Description | Default | Required | Priority
| *camel.sink.path.database* | database name | null | true | HIGH
| *camel.sink.endpoint.documentCollection* | Collection name, when using ArangoDb as a Document Database. Set the documentCollection name when using the CRUD operation on the document database collections (SAVE_DOCUMENT , FIND_DOCUMENT_BY_KEY, UPDATE_DOCUMENT, DELETE_DOCUMENT). | null | false | MEDIUM
| *camel.sink.endpoint.edgeCollection* | Collection name of vertices, when using ArangoDb as a Graph Database. Set the edgeCollection name to perform CRUD operation on edges using these operations : SAVE_VERTEX, FIND_VERTEX_BY_KEY, UPDATE_VERTEX, DELETE_VERTEX. The graph attribute is mandatory. | null | false | MEDIUM
| *camel.sink.endpoint.graph* | Graph name, when using ArangoDb as a Graph Database. Combine this attribute with one of the two attributes vertexCollection and edgeCollection. | null | false | MEDIUM
| *camel.sink.endpoint.host* | ArangoDB host. If host and port are default, this field is Optional. | null | false | MEDIUM
| *camel.sink.endpoint.lazyStartProducer* | Whether the producer should be started lazy (on the first message). By starting lazy you can use this to allow CamelContext and routes to startup in situations where a producer may otherwise fail during starting and cause the route to fail being started. By deferring this startup to be lazy then the startup failure can be handled during routing messages via Camel's routing error handlers. Beware that when the first message is processed then creating and starting the producer may take a little time and prolong the total processing time of the processing. | false | false | MEDIUM
| *camel.sink.endpoint.operation* | Operations to perform on ArangoDb. For the operation AQL_QUERY, no need to specify a collection or graph. One of: [SAVE_DOCUMENT] [FIND_DOCUMENT_BY_KEY] [UPDATE_DOCUMENT] [DELETE_DOCUMENT] [AQL_QUERY] [SAVE_VERTEX] [FIND_VERTEX_BY_KEY] [UPDATE_VERTEX] [DELETE_VERTEX] [SAVE_EDGE] [FIND_EDGE_BY_KEY] [UPDATE_EDGE] [DELETE_EDGE] | null | false | MEDIUM
| *camel.sink.endpoint.port* | ArangoDB exposed port. If host and port are default, this field is Optional. | null | false | MEDIUM
| *camel.sink.endpoint.vertexCollection* | Collection name of vertices, when using ArangoDb as a Graph Database. Set the vertexCollection name to perform CRUD operation on vertices using these operations : SAVE_EDGE, FIND_EDGE_BY_KEY, UPDATE_EDGE, DELETE_EDGE. The graph attribute is mandatory. | null | false | MEDIUM
| *camel.sink.endpoint.password* | ArangoDB password. If user and password are default, this field is Optional. | null | false | MEDIUM
| *camel.sink.endpoint.user* | ArangoDB user. If user and password are default, this field is Optional. | null | false | MEDIUM
| *camel.component.arangodb.configuration* | Component configuration | null | false | MEDIUM
| *camel.component.arangodb.documentCollection* | Collection name, when using ArangoDb as a Document Database. Set the documentCollection name when using the CRUD operation on the document database collections (SAVE_DOCUMENT , FIND_DOCUMENT_BY_KEY, UPDATE_DOCUMENT, DELETE_DOCUMENT). | null | false | MEDIUM
| *camel.component.arangodb.edgeCollection* | Collection name of vertices, when using ArangoDb as a Graph Database. Set the edgeCollection name to perform CRUD operation on edges using these operations : SAVE_VERTEX, FIND_VERTEX_BY_KEY, UPDATE_VERTEX, DELETE_VERTEX. The graph attribute is mandatory. | null | false | MEDIUM
| *camel.component.arangodb.graph* | Graph name, when using ArangoDb as a Graph Database. Combine this attribute with one of the two attributes vertexCollection and edgeCollection. | null | false | MEDIUM
| *camel.component.arangodb.host* | ArangoDB host. If host and port are default, this field is Optional. | null | false | MEDIUM
| *camel.component.arangodb.lazyStartProducer* | Whether the producer should be started lazy (on the first message). By starting lazy you can use this to allow CamelContext and routes to startup in situations where a producer may otherwise fail during starting and cause the route to fail being started. By deferring this startup to be lazy then the startup failure can be handled during routing messages via Camel's routing error handlers.

| *camel.component.arangodb.operation* | Operations to perform on ArangoDb. For the operation AQL_QUERY, no need to specify a collection or graph. One of: [SAVE_DOCUMENT] [FIND_DOCUMENT_BY_KEY] [UPDATE_DOCUMENT] [DELETE_DOCUMENT] [AQL_QUERY] [SAVE_VERTEX] [FIND_VERTEX_BY_KEY] [UPDATE_VERTEX] [DELETE_VERTEX] [SAVE_EDGE] [FIND_EDGE_BY_KEY] [UPDATE_EDGE] [DELETE_EDGE] | null | false | MEDIUM
| *camel.component.arangodb.port* | ArangoDB exposed port. If host and port are default, this field is Optional. | null | false | MEDIUM
| *camel.component.arangodb.vertexCollection* | Collection name of vertices, when using ArangoDb as a Graph Database. Set the vertexCollection name to perform CRUD operation on vertices using these operations : SAVE_EDGE, FIND_EDGE_BY_KEY, UPDATE_EDGE, DELETE_EDGE. The graph attribute is mandatory. | null | false | MEDIUM
| *camel.component.arangodb.autowiredEnabled* | Whether autowiring is enabled. This is used for automatic autowiring options (the option must be marked as autowired) by looking up in the registry to find if there is a single instance of matching type, which then gets configured on the component. This can be used for automatic configuring JDBC data sources, JMS connection factories, AWS Clients, etc. | true | false | MEDIUM
| *camel.component.arangodb.password* | ArangoDB password. If user and password are default, this field is Optional. | null | false | MEDIUM
| *camel.component.arangodb.user* | ArangoDB user. If user and password are default, this field is Optional. | null | false | MEDIUM
