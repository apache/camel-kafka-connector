|===
| Name | Description | Default | Required | Priority
| *camel.sink.path.bucketName* | Bucket name or ARN | null | true | HIGH
| *camel.sink.endpoint.autoCreateBucket* | Setting the autocreation of the bucket bucketName. | true | false | MEDIUM
| *camel.sink.endpoint.serviceAccountKey* | The Service account key that can be used as credentials for the Storage client. It can be loaded by default from classpath, but you can prefix with classpath:, file:, or http: to load the resource from different systems. | null | false | MEDIUM
| *camel.sink.endpoint.storageClass* | The Cloud Storage class to use when creating the new buckets | "STANDARD" | false | MEDIUM
| *camel.sink.endpoint.storageClient* | The storage client | null | false | MEDIUM
| *camel.sink.endpoint.storageLocation* | The Cloud Storage location to use when creating the new buckets | "US-EAST1" | false | MEDIUM
| *camel.sink.endpoint.lazyStartProducer* | Whether the producer should be started lazy (on the first message). By starting lazy you can use this to allow CamelContext and routes to startup in situations where a producer may otherwise fail during starting and cause the route to fail being started. By deferring this startup to be lazy then the startup failure can be handled during routing messages via Camel's routing error handlers. Beware that when the first message is processed then creating and starting the producer may take a little time and prolong the total processing time of the processing. | false | false | MEDIUM
| *camel.sink.endpoint.objectName* | The Object name inside the bucket | null | false | MEDIUM
| *camel.sink.endpoint.operation* | Set the operation for the producer One of: [copyObject] [listObjects] [deleteObject] [deleteBucket] [listBuckets] [getObject] [createDownloadLink] | null | false | MEDIUM
| *camel.component.google-storage.autoCreateBucket* | Setting the autocreation of the bucket bucketName. | true | false | MEDIUM
| *camel.component.google-storage.configuration* | The component configuration | null | false | MEDIUM
| *camel.component.google-storage.serviceAccountKey* | The Service account key that can be used as credentials for the Storage client. It can be loaded by default from classpath, but you can prefix with classpath:, file:, or http: to load the resource from different systems. | null | false | MEDIUM
| *camel.component.google-storage.storageClass* | The Cloud Storage class to use when creating the new buckets | "STANDARD" | false | MEDIUM

| *camel.component.google-storage.autowiredEnabled* | Whether autowiring is enabled. This is used for automatic autowiring options (the option must be marked as autowired) by looking up in the registry to find if there is a single instance of matching type, which then gets configured on the component. This can be used for automatic configuring JDBC data sources, JMS connection factories, AWS Clients, etc. | true | false | MEDIUM
