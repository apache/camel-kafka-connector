[width="100%",cols="2,5,^1,1,1",options="header"]
|===
| Name | Description | Default | Required | Priority
| *camel.source.path.bucketName* | Bucket name | null | true | HIGH
| *camel.source.endpoint.autoCreateBucket* | Setting the autocreation of the bucket if bucket name not exist. | true | false | MEDIUM
| *camel.source.endpoint.customHttpClient* | Set custom HTTP client for authenticated access. | null | false | MEDIUM
| *camel.source.endpoint.endpoint* | Endpoint can be an URL, domain name, IPv4 address or IPv6 address. | null | false | MEDIUM
| *camel.source.endpoint.minioClient* | Reference to a Minio Client object in the registry. | null | false | MEDIUM
| *camel.source.endpoint.objectLock* | Set when creating new bucket. | false | false | MEDIUM
| *camel.source.endpoint.policy* | The policy for this queue to set in the method. | null | false | MEDIUM
| *camel.source.endpoint.proxyPort* | TCP/IP port number. 80 and 443 are used as defaults for HTTP and HTTPS. | null | false | MEDIUM
| *camel.source.endpoint.region* | The region in which Minio client needs to work. When using this parameter, the configuration will expect the lowercase name of the region (for example ap-east-1). You'll need to use the name Region.EU_WEST_1.id() | null | false | MEDIUM
| *camel.source.endpoint.secure* | Flag to indicate to use secure connection to minio service or not. | false | false | MEDIUM
| *camel.source.endpoint.serverSideEncryption* | Server-side encryption. | null | false | MEDIUM
| *camel.source.endpoint.serverSideEncryptionCustomer Key* | Server-side encryption for source object while copy/move objects. | null | false | MEDIUM
| *camel.source.endpoint.autoCloseBody* | If this option is true and includeBody is true, then the MinioObject.close() method will be called on exchange completion. This option is strongly related to includeBody option. In case of setting includeBody to true and autocloseBody to false, it will be up to the caller to close the MinioObject stream. Setting autocloseBody to true, will close the MinioObject stream automatically. | true | false | MEDIUM
| *camel.source.endpoint.bridgeErrorHandler* | Allows for bridging the consumer to the Camel routing Error Handler, which mean any exceptions occurred while the consumer is trying to pickup incoming messages, or the likes, will now be processed as a message and handled by the routing Error Handler. By default the consumer will use the org.apache.camel.spi.ExceptionHandler to deal with exceptions, that will be logged at WARN or ERROR level and ignored. | false | false | MEDIUM
| *camel.source.endpoint.bypassGovernanceMode* | Set this flag if you want to bypassGovernanceMode when deleting a particular object. | false | false | MEDIUM
| *camel.source.endpoint.deleteAfterRead* | Delete objects from Minio after they have been retrieved. The delete is only performed if the Exchange is committed. If a rollback occurs, the object is not deleted. If this option is false, then the same objects will be retrieve over and over again on the polls. Therefore you need to use the Idempotent Consumer EIP in the route to filter out duplicates. You can filter using the MinioConstants#BUCKET_NAME and MinioConstants#OBJECT_NAME headers, or only the MinioConstants#OBJECT_NAME header. | true | false | MEDIUM
| *camel.source.endpoint.delimiter* | The delimiter which is used in the ListObjectsRequest to only consume objects we are interested in. | null | false | MEDIUM
| *camel.source.endpoint.destinationBucketName* | Source bucket name. | null | false | MEDIUM
| *camel.source.endpoint.destinationObjectName* | Source object name. | null | false | MEDIUM
| *camel.source.endpoint.includeBody* | If it is true, the exchange body will be set to a stream to the contents of the file. If false, the headers will be set with the Minio object metadata, but the body will be null. This option is strongly related to autocloseBody option. In case of setting includeBody to true and autocloseBody to false, it will be up to the caller to close the MinioObject stream. Setting autocloseBody to true, will close the MinioObject stream automatically. | true | false | MEDIUM
| *camel.source.endpoint.includeFolders* | The flag which is used in the ListObjectsRequest to set include folders. | false | false | MEDIUM
| *camel.source.endpoint.includeUserMetadata* | The flag which is used in the ListObjectsRequest to get objects with user meta data. | false | false | MEDIUM
| *camel.source.endpoint.includeVersions* | The flag which is used in the ListObjectsRequest to get objects with versioning. | false | false | MEDIUM
| *camel.source.endpoint.length* | Number of bytes of object data from offset. | null | false | MEDIUM

| *camel.source.endpoint.maxMessagesPerPoll* | Gets the maximum number of messages as a limit to poll at each polling. Gets the maximum number of messages as a limit to poll at each polling. The default value is 10. Use 0 or a negative number to set it as unlimited. | 10 | false | MEDIUM
| *camel.source.endpoint.modifiedSince* | Set modified since parameter for get object(s). | null | false | MEDIUM
| *camel.source.endpoint.moveAfterRead* | Move objects from bucket to a different bucket after they have been retrieved. To accomplish the operation the destinationBucket option must be set. The copy bucket operation is only performed if the Exchange is committed. If a rollback occurs, the object is not moved. | false | false | MEDIUM
| *camel.source.endpoint.notMatchETag* | Set not match ETag parameter for get object(s). | null | false | MEDIUM
| *camel.source.endpoint.objectName* | To get the object from the bucket with the given object name. | null | false | MEDIUM
| *camel.source.endpoint.offset* | Start byte position of object data. | null | false | MEDIUM
| *camel.source.endpoint.prefix* | Object name starts with prefix. | null | false | MEDIUM
| *camel.source.endpoint.recursive* | List recursively than directory structure emulation. | false | false | MEDIUM
| *camel.source.endpoint.sendEmptyMessageWhenIdle* | If the polling consumer did not poll any files, you can enable this option to send an empty message (no body) instead. | false | false | MEDIUM
| *camel.source.endpoint.startAfter* | list objects in bucket after this object name. | null | false | MEDIUM
| *camel.source.endpoint.unModifiedSince* | Set un modified since parameter for get object(s). | null | false | MEDIUM

| *camel.source.endpoint.pollStrategy* | A pluggable org.apache.camel.PollingConsumerPollingStrategy allowing you to provide your custom implementation to control error handling usually occurred during the poll operation before an Exchange have been created and being routed in Camel. | null | false | MEDIUM
| *camel.source.endpoint.backoffErrorThreshold* | The number of subsequent error polls (failed due some error) that should happen before the backoffMultipler should kick-in. | null | false | MEDIUM
| *camel.source.endpoint.backoffIdleThreshold* | The number of subsequent idle polls that should happen before the backoffMultipler should kick-in. | null | false | MEDIUM
| *camel.source.endpoint.backoffMultiplier* | To let the scheduled polling consumer backoff if there has been a number of subsequent idles/errors in a row. The multiplier is then the number of polls that will be skipped before the next actual attempt is happening again. When this option is in use then backoffIdleThreshold and/or backoffErrorThreshold must also be configured. | null | false | MEDIUM
| *camel.source.endpoint.delay* | Milliseconds before the next poll. | 500L | false | MEDIUM
| *camel.source.endpoint.greedy* | If greedy is enabled, then the ScheduledPollConsumer will run immediately again, if the previous run polled 1 or more messages. | false | false | MEDIUM
| *camel.source.endpoint.initialDelay* | Milliseconds before the first poll starts. | 1000L | false | MEDIUM
| *camel.source.endpoint.repeatCount* | Specifies a maximum limit of number of fires. So if you set it to 1, the scheduler will only fire once. If you set it to 5, it will only fire five times. A value of zero or negative means fire forever. | 0L | false | MEDIUM
