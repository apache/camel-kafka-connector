Connector description: Receive messages from AWS DynamoDB Stream service.

When using camel-aws-ddbstream-kafka-connector as source make sure to use the following Maven dependency to have support for the connector:

[source,xml]
----
<dependency>
  <groupId>org.apache.camel.kafkaconnector</groupId>
  <artifactId>camel-aws-ddbstream-kafka-connector</artifactId>
  <version>x.x.x</version>
  <!-- use the same version as your Camel Kafka connector version -->
</dependency>
----

To use this Source connector in Kafka connect you'll need to set the following connector.class

[source,java]
----
connector.class=org.apache.camel.kafkaconnector.awsddbstream.CamelAwsddbstreamSourceConnector
----


The camel-aws-ddbstream source connector supports 45 options, which are listed below.



[width="100%",cols="2,5,^1,1,1",options="header"]
|===
| Name | Description | Default | Required | Priority
| *camel.source.path.tableName* | Name of the dynamodb table | null | true | HIGH
| *camel.source.endpoint.autoDiscoverClient* | Setting the autoDiscoverClient mechanism, if true, the component will look for a client instance in the registry automatically otherwise it will skip that checking | true | false | MEDIUM
| *camel.source.endpoint.amazonDynamoDbStreamsClient* | Amazon DynamoDB client to use for all requests for this endpoint | null | false | MEDIUM
| *camel.source.endpoint.bridgeErrorHandler* | Allows for bridging the consumer to the Camel routing Error Handler, which mean any exceptions occurred while the consumer is trying to pickup incoming messages, or the likes, will now be processed as a message and handled by the routing Error Handler. By default the consumer will use the org.apache.camel.spi.ExceptionHandler to deal with exceptions, that will be logged at WARN or ERROR level and ignored. | false | false | MEDIUM
| *camel.source.endpoint.iteratorType* | Defines where in the DynaboDB stream to start getting records. Note that using TRIM_HORIZON can cause a significant delay before the stream has caught up to real-time. if {AT,AFTER}_SEQUENCE_NUMBER are used, then a sequenceNumberProvider MUST be supplied. One of: [TRIM_HORIZON] [LATEST] [AT_SEQUENCE_NUMBER] [AFTER_SEQUENCE_NUMBER] | "LATEST" | false | MEDIUM
| *camel.source.endpoint.maxResultsPerRequest* | Maximum number of records that will be fetched in each poll | null | false | MEDIUM
| *camel.source.endpoint.proxyHost* | To define a proxy host when instantiating the DDBStreams client | null | false | MEDIUM
| *camel.source.endpoint.proxyPort* | To define a proxy port when instantiating the DDBStreams client | null | false | MEDIUM
| *camel.source.endpoint.proxyProtocol* | To define a proxy protocol when instantiating the DDBStreams client One of: [HTTP] [HTTPS] | "HTTPS" | false | MEDIUM
| *camel.source.endpoint.region* | The region in which DDBStreams client needs to work | null | false | MEDIUM
| *camel.source.endpoint.sendEmptyMessageWhenIdle* | If the polling consumer did not poll any files, you can enable this option to send an empty message (no body) instead. | false | false | MEDIUM
| *camel.source.endpoint.sequenceNumberProvider* | Provider for the sequence number when using one of the two ShardIteratorType.{AT,AFTER}_SEQUENCE_NUMBER iterator types. Can be a registry reference or a literal sequence number. | null | false | MEDIUM
| *camel.source.endpoint.exceptionHandler* | To let the consumer use a custom ExceptionHandler. Notice if the option bridgeErrorHandler is enabled then this option is not in use. By default the consumer will deal with exceptions, that will be logged at WARN or ERROR level and ignored. | null | false | MEDIUM
| *camel.source.endpoint.exchangePattern* | Sets the exchange pattern when the consumer creates an exchange. One of: [InOnly] [InOut] [InOptionalOut] | null | false | MEDIUM
| *camel.source.endpoint.pollStrategy* | A pluggable org.apache.camel.PollingConsumerPollingStrategy allowing you to provide your custom implementation to control error handling usually occurred during the poll operation before an Exchange have been created and being routed in Camel. | null | false | MEDIUM
| *camel.source.endpoint.backoffErrorThreshold* | The number of subsequent error polls (failed due some error) that should happen before the backoffMultipler should kick-in. | null | false | MEDIUM
| *camel.source.endpoint.backoffIdleThreshold* | The number of subsequent idle polls that should happen before the backoffMultipler should kick-in. | null | false | MEDIUM
| *camel.source.endpoint.backoffMultiplier* | To let the scheduled polling consumer backoff if there has been a number of subsequent idles/errors in a row. The multiplier is then the number of polls that will be skipped before the next actual attempt is happening again. When this option is in use then backoffIdleThreshold and/or backoffErrorThreshold must also be configured. | null | false | MEDIUM
| *camel.source.endpoint.delay* | Milliseconds before the next poll. | 500L | false | MEDIUM
| *camel.source.endpoint.greedy* | If greedy is enabled, then the ScheduledPollConsumer will run immediately again, if the previous run polled 1 or more messages. | false | false | MEDIUM
| *camel.source.endpoint.initialDelay* | Milliseconds before the first poll starts. | 1000L | false | MEDIUM
| *camel.source.endpoint.repeatCount* | Specifies a maximum limit of number of fires. So if you set it to 1, the scheduler will only fire once. If you set it to 5, it will only fire five times. A value of zero or negative means fire forever. | 0L | false | MEDIUM
| *camel.source.endpoint.runLoggingLevel* | The consumer logs a start/complete log line when it polls. This option allows you to configure the logging level for that. One of: [TRACE] [DEBUG] [INFO] [WARN] [ERROR] [OFF] | "TRACE" | false | MEDIUM
| *camel.source.endpoint.scheduledExecutorService* | Allows for configuring a custom/shared thread pool to use for the consumer. By default each consumer has its own single threaded thread pool. | null | false | MEDIUM

| *camel.component.aws-ddbstream.amazonDynamoDb StreamsClient* | Amazon DynamoDB client to use for all requests for this endpoint | null | false | MEDIUM
| *camel.component.aws-ddbstream.bridgeErrorHandler* | Allows for bridging the consumer to the Camel routing Error Handler, which mean any exceptions occurred while the consumer is trying to pickup incoming messages, or the likes, will now be processed as a message and handled by the routing Error Handler. By default the consumer will use the org.apache.camel.spi.ExceptionHandler to deal with exceptions, that will be logged at WARN or ERROR level and ignored. | false | false | MEDIUM
| *camel.component.aws-ddbstream.configuration* | The component configuration | null | false | MEDIUM
| *camel.component.aws-ddbstream.iteratorType* | Defines where in the DynaboDB stream to start getting records. Note that using TRIM_HORIZON can cause a significant delay before the stream has caught up to real-time. if {AT,AFTER}_SEQUENCE_NUMBER are used, then a sequenceNumberProvider MUST be supplied. One of: [TRIM_HORIZON] [LATEST] [AT_SEQUENCE_NUMBER] [AFTER_SEQUENCE_NUMBER] | "LATEST" | false | MEDIUM

| *camel.component.aws-ddbstream.autowiredEnabled* | Whether autowiring is enabled. This is used for automatic autowiring options (the option must be marked as autowired) by looking up in the registry to find if there is a single instance of matching type, which then gets configured on the component. This can be used for automatic configuring JDBC data sources, JMS connection factories, AWS Clients, etc. | true | false | MEDIUM
| *camel.component.aws-ddbstream.accessKey* | Amazon AWS Access Key | null | false | MEDIUM
