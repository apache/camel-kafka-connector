Connector Description: Find geocodes (latitude and longitude) for a given address or the other way round.

When using camel-geocoder-kafka-connector as sink make sure to use the following Maven dependency to have support for the connector:

[source,xml]
----
<dependency>
  <groupId>org.apache.camel.kafkaconnector</groupId>
  <artifactId>camel-geocoder-kafka-connector</artifactId>
  <version>x.x.x</version>
  <!-- use the same version as your Camel Kafka connector version -->
</dependency>
----

To use this Sink connector in Kafka connect you'll need to set the following connector.class

[source,java]
----
connector.class=org.apache.camel.kafkaconnector.geocoder.CamelGeocoderSinkConnector
----


The camel-geocoder sink connector supports 20 options, which are listed below.



[width="100%",cols="2,5,^1,1,1",options="header"]
|===
| Name | Description | Default | Required | Priority
| *camel.sink.path.address* | The geo address which should be prefixed with address: | null | false | MEDIUM
| *camel.sink.path.latlng* | The geo latitude and longitude which should be prefixed with latlng: | null | false | MEDIUM
| *camel.sink.endpoint.headersOnly* | Whether to only enrich the Exchange with headers, and leave the body as-is. | false | false | MEDIUM
| *camel.sink.endpoint.language* | The language to use. | "en" | false | MEDIUM
| *camel.sink.endpoint.lazyStartProducer* | Whether the producer should be started lazy (on the first message). By starting lazy you can use this to allow CamelContext and routes to startup in situations where a producer may otherwise fail during starting and cause the route to fail being started. By deferring this startup to be lazy then the startup failure can be handled during routing messages via Camel's routing error handlers. Beware that when the first message is processed then creating and starting the producer may take a little time and prolong the total processing time of the processing. | false | false | MEDIUM
| *camel.sink.endpoint.serverUrl* | URL to the geocoder server. Mandatory for Nominatim server. | null | false | MEDIUM
| *camel.sink.endpoint.type* | Type of GeoCoding server. Supported Nominatim and Google. One of: [NOMINATIM] [GOOGLE] | null | false | MEDIUM
| *camel.sink.endpoint.proxyAuthDomain* | Proxy Authentication Domain to access Google GeoCoding server. | null | false | MEDIUM
| *camel.sink.endpoint.proxyAuthHost* | Proxy Authentication Host to access Google GeoCoding server. | null | false | MEDIUM
| *camel.sink.endpoint.proxyAuthMethod* | Authentication Method to Google GeoCoding server. | null | false | MEDIUM
| *camel.sink.endpoint.proxyAuthPassword* | Proxy Password to access GeoCoding server. | null | false | MEDIUM
| *camel.sink.endpoint.proxyAuthUsername* | Proxy Username to access GeoCoding server. | null | false | MEDIUM
| *camel.sink.endpoint.proxyHost* | Proxy Host to access GeoCoding server. | null | false | MEDIUM
| *camel.sink.endpoint.proxyPort* | Proxy Port to access GeoCoding server. | null | false | MEDIUM
| *camel.sink.endpoint.apiKey* | API Key to access Google. Mandatory for Google GeoCoding server. | null | false | MEDIUM
| *camel.sink.endpoint.clientId* | Client ID to access Google GeoCoding server. | null | false | MEDIUM
| *camel.sink.endpoint.clientKey* | Client Key to access Google GeoCoding server. | null | false | MEDIUM
| *camel.component.geocoder.lazyStartProducer* | Whether the producer should be started lazy (on the first message). By starting lazy you can use this to allow CamelContext and routes to startup in situations where a producer may otherwise fail during starting and cause the route to fail being started. By deferring this startup to be lazy then the startup failure can be handled during routing messages via Camel's routing error handlers. Beware that when the first message is processed then creating and starting the producer may take a little time and prolong the total processing time of the processing. | false | false | MEDIUM
| *camel.component.geocoder.autowiredEnabled* | Whether autowiring is enabled. This is used for automatic autowiring options (the option must be marked as autowired) by looking up in the registry to find if there is a single instance of matching type, which then gets configured on the component. This can be used for automatic configuring JDBC data sources, JMS connection factories, AWS Clients, etc. | true | false | MEDIUM
| *camel.component.geocoder.geoApiContext* | Configuration for Google maps API | null | false | MEDIUM
