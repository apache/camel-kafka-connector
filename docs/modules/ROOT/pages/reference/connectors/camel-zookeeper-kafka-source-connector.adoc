| *camel.source.path.path* | The node in the ZooKeeper server (aka znode) | null | true | HIGH

By default the consumer will use the org.apache.camel.spi.ExceptionHandler to deal with exceptions, that will be logged at WARN or ERROR level and ignored. | false | false | MEDIUM
| *camel.source.endpoint.repeat* | Should changes to the znode be 'watched' and repeatedly processed. | false | false | MEDIUM
| *camel.source.endpoint.sendEmptyMessageOnDelete* | Upon the delete of a znode, should an empty message be send to the consumer | true | false | MEDIUM
| *camel.source.endpoint.exceptionHandler* | To let the consumer use a custom ExceptionHandler. Notice if the option bridgeErrorHandler is enabled then this option is not in use. By default the consumer will deal with exceptions, that will be logged at WARN or ERROR level and ignored. | null | false | MEDIUM

| *camel.component.zookeeper.autowiredEnabled* | Whether autowiring is enabled. This is used for automatic autowiring options (the option must be marked as autowired) by looking up in the registry to find if there is a single instance of matching type, which then gets configured on the component.
