| Name | Description | Default | Required | Priority
| *camel.sink.path.apiName* | What kind of operation to perform One of: [COLLABORATIONS] [COMMENTS] [EVENT_LOGS] [FILES] [FOLDERS] [GROUPS] [EVENTS] [SEARCH] [TASKS] [USERS] | null | true | HIGH
| *camel.sink.path.methodName* | What sub operation to use for the selected operation | null | true | HIGH
| *camel.sink.endpoint.clientId* | Box application client ID | null | false | MEDIUM
| *camel.sink.endpoint.enterpriseId* | The enterprise ID to use for an App Enterprise. | null | false | MEDIUM
| *camel.sink.endpoint.inBody* | Sets the name of a parameter to be passed in the exchange In Body | null | false | MEDIUM
| *camel.sink.endpoint.userId* | The user ID to use for an App User. | null | false | MEDIUM
| *camel.sink.endpoint.lazyStartProducer* | Whether the producer should be started lazy (on the first message). By starting lazy you can use this to allow CamelContext and routes to startup in situations where a producer may otherwise fail during starting and cause the route to fail being started. By deferring this startup to be lazy then the startup failure can be handled during routing messages via Camel's routing error handlers. Beware that when the first message is processed then creating and starting the producer may take a little time and prolong the total processing time of the processing. | false | false | MEDIUM
| *camel.sink.endpoint.httpParams* | Custom HTTP params for settings like proxy host | null | false | MEDIUM
| *camel.sink.endpoint.authenticationType* | The type of authentication for connection. Types of Authentication: STANDARD_AUTHENTICATION - OAuth 2.0 (3-legged) SERVER_AUTHENTICATION - OAuth 2.0 with JSON Web Tokens | "APP_USER_AUTHENTICATION" | false | MEDIUM
| *camel.sink.endpoint.accessTokenCache* | Custom Access Token Cache for storing and retrieving access tokens. | null | false | MEDIUM

This is used for automatic autowiring options (the option must be marked as autowired) by looking up in the registry to find if there is a single instance of matching type, which then gets configured on the component. This can be used for automatic configuring JDBC data sources, JMS connection factories, AWS Clients, etc. | true | false | MEDIUM
