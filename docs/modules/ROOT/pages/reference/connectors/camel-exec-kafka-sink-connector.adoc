Connector Description: Execute commands on the underlying operating system.

When using camel-exec-kafka-connector as sink make sure to use the following Maven dependency to have support for the connector:

[source,xml]
----
<dependency>
  <groupId>org.apache.camel.kafkaconnector</groupId>
  <artifactId>camel-exec-kafka-connector</artifactId>
  <version>x.x.x</version>
  <!-- use the same version as your Camel Kafka connector version -->
</dependency>
----

To use this Sink connector in Kafka connect you'll need to set the following connector.class

[source,java]
----
connector.class=org.apache.camel.kafkaconnector.exec.CamelExecSinkConnector
----


The camel-exec sink connector supports 12 options, which are listed below.



[width="100%",cols="2,5,^1,1,1",options="header"]
|===
| Name | Description | Default | Required | Priority
| *camel.sink.path.executable* | Sets the executable to be executed. The executable must not be empty or null. | null | true | HIGH
| *camel.sink.endpoint.args* | The arguments may be one or many whitespace-separated tokens. | null | false | MEDIUM
| *camel.sink.endpoint.binding* | A reference to a org.apache.commons.exec.ExecBinding in the Registry. | null | false | MEDIUM
| *camel.sink.endpoint.commandExecutor* | A reference to a org.apache.commons.exec.ExecCommandExecutor in the Registry that customizes the command execution. The default command executor utilizes the commons-exec library, which adds a shutdown hook for every executed command. | null | false | MEDIUM
| *camel.sink.endpoint.commandLogLevel* | Logging level to be used for commands during execution. The default value is DEBUG. Possible values are TRACE, DEBUG, INFO, WARN, ERROR or OFF. (Values of ExecCommandLogLevelType enum) One of: [TRACE] [DEBUG] [INFO] [WARN] [ERROR] [OFF] | "DEBUG" | false | MEDIUM
| *camel.sink.endpoint.lazyStartProducer* | Whether the producer should be started lazy (on the first message). By starting lazy you can use this to allow CamelContext and routes to startup in situations where a producer may otherwise fail during starting and cause the route to fail being started. By deferring this startup to be lazy then the startup failure can be handled during routing messages via Camel's routing error handlers. Beware that when the first message is processed then creating and starting the producer may take a little time and prolong the total processing time of the processing. | false | false | MEDIUM
| *camel.sink.endpoint.outFile* | The name of a file, created by the executable, that should be considered as its output. If no outFile is set, the standard output (stdout) of the executable will be used instead. | null | false | MEDIUM
| *camel.sink.endpoint.timeout* | The timeout, in milliseconds, after which the executable should be terminated. If execution has not completed within the timeout, the component will send a termination request. | null | false | MEDIUM
| *camel.sink.endpoint.useStderrOnEmptyStdout* | A boolean indicating that when stdout is empty, this component will populate the Camel Message Body with stderr. This behavior is disabled (false) by default. | false | false | MEDIUM
| *camel.sink.endpoint.workingDir* | The directory in which the command should be executed. If null, the working directory of the current process will be used. | null | false | MEDIUM
| *camel.component.exec.lazyStartProducer* | Whether the producer should be started lazy (on the first message). By starting lazy you can use this to allow CamelContext and routes to startup in situations where a producer may otherwise fail during starting and cause the route to fail being started. By deferring this startup to be lazy then the startup failure can be handled during routing messages via Camel's routing error handlers. Beware that when the first message is processed then creating and starting the producer may take a little time and prolong the total processing time of the processing. | false | false | MEDIUM
| *camel.component.exec.autowiredEnabled* | Whether autowiring is enabled. This is used for automatic autowiring options (the option must be marked as autowired) by looking up in the registry to find if there is a single instance of matching type, which then gets configured on the component. This can be used for automatic configuring JDBC data sources, JMS connection factories, AWS Clients, etc. | true | false | MEDIUM
