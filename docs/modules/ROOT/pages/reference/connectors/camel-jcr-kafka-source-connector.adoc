| *camel.source.endpoint.nodeTypeNames* | When a comma separated nodeTypeName list string is set, only events whose associated parent node has one of the node types (or a subtype of one of the node types) in this list will be received. | null | false | MEDIUM
| *camel.source.endpoint.noLocal* | If noLocal is true, then events generated by the session through which the listener was registered are ignored. Otherwise, they are not ignored. | false | false | MEDIUM
| *camel.source.endpoint.password* | Password for login | null | false | MEDIUM
| *camel.source.endpoint.sessionLiveCheckInterval* | Interval in milliseconds to wait before each session live checking The default value is 60000 ms. | 60000L | false | MEDIUM

| *camel.source.endpoint.bridgeErrorHandler* | Allows for bridging the consumer to the Camel routing Error Handler, which mean any exceptions occurred while the consumer is trying to pickup incoming messages, or the likes, will now be processed as a message and handled by the routing Error Handler. By default the consumer will use the org.apache.camel.spi.ExceptionHandler to deal with exceptions, that will be logged at WARN or ERROR level and ignored. | false | false | MEDIUM
| *camel.source.endpoint.exceptionHandler* | To let the consumer use a custom ExceptionHandler. Notice if the option bridgeErrorHandler is enabled then this option is not in use. By default the consumer will deal with exceptions, that will be logged at WARN or ERROR level and ignored. | null | false | MEDIUM
| *camel.source.endpoint.exchangePattern* | Sets the exchange pattern when the consumer creates an exchange. One of: [InOnly] [InOut] [InOptionalOut] | null | false | MEDIUM

This is used for automatic autowiring options (the option must be marked as autowired) by looking up in the registry to find if there is a single instance of matching type, which then gets configured on the component.
