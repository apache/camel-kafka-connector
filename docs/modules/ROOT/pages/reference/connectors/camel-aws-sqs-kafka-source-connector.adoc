Connector description: Sending and receive messages to/from AWS SQS service.

When using camel-aws-sqs-kafka-connector as source make sure to use the following Maven dependency to have support for the connector:

[source,xml]
----
<dependency>
  <groupId>org.apache.camel.kafkaconnector</groupId>
  <artifactId>camel-aws-sqs-kafka-connector</artifactId>
  <version>x.x.x</version>
  <!-- use the same version as your Camel Kafka connector version -->
</dependency>
----

To use this Source connector in Kafka connect you'll need to set the following connector.class

[source,java]
----
connector.class=org.apache.camel.kafkaconnector.awssqs.CamelAwssqsSourceConnector
----


The camel-aws-sqs source connector supports 87 options, which are listed below.

| *camel.source.endpoint.amazonSQSClient* | To use the AmazonSQS as client | null | false | MEDIUM
| *camel.source.endpoint.autoCreateQueue* | Setting the autocreation of the queue | true | false | MEDIUM
| *camel.source.endpoint.autoDiscoverClient* | Setting the autoDiscoverClient mechanism, if true, the component will look for a client instance in the registry automatically otherwise it will skip that checking. | true | false | MEDIUM

| *camel.source.endpoint.protocol* | The underlying protocol used to communicate with SQS | "https" | false | MEDIUM
| *camel.source.endpoint.proxyProtocol* | To define a proxy protocol when instantiating the SQS client One of: [HTTP] [HTTPS] | "HTTPS" | false | MEDIUM
| *camel.source.endpoint.queueOwnerAWSAccountId* | Specify the queue owner aws account id when you need to connect the queue with different account owner. | null | false | MEDIUM
| *camel.source.endpoint.region* | Specify the queue region which could be used with queueOwnerAWSAccountId to build the service URL. When using this parameter, the configuration will expect the capitalized name of the region (for example AP_EAST_1) You'll need to use the name Regions.EU_WEST_1.name() | null | false | MEDIUM
| *camel.source.endpoint.attributeNames* | A list of attribute names to receive when consuming. Multiple names can be separated by comma. | null | false | MEDIUM
| *camel.source.endpoint.bridgeErrorHandler* | Allows for bridging the consumer to the Camel routing Error Handler, which mean any exceptions occurred while the consumer is trying to pickup incoming messages, or the likes, will now be processed as a message and handled by the routing Error Handler. By default the consumer will use the org.apache.camel.spi.ExceptionHandler to deal with exceptions, that will be logged at WARN or ERROR level and ignored. | false | false | MEDIUM
| *camel.source.endpoint.concurrentConsumers* | Allows you to use multiple threads to poll the sqs queue to increase throughput | 1 | false | MEDIUM

| *camel.source.endpoint.waitTimeSeconds* | Duration in seconds (0 to 20) that the ReceiveMessage action call will wait until a message is in the queue to include in the response. | null | false | MEDIUM
| *camel.source.endpoint.exceptionHandler* | To let the consumer use a custom ExceptionHandler. Notice if the option bridgeErrorHandler is enabled then this option is not in use. By default the consumer will deal with exceptions, that will be logged at WARN or ERROR level and ignored. | null | false | MEDIUM

| *camel.source.endpoint.backoffMultiplier* | To let the scheduled polling consumer backoff if there has been a number of subsequent idles/errors in a row. The multiplier is then the number of polls that will be skipped before the next actual attempt is happening again.

| *camel.source.endpoint.delay* | Milliseconds before the next poll. | 500L | false | MEDIUM
| *camel.source.endpoint.greedy* | If greedy is enabled, then the ScheduledPollConsumer will run immediately again, if the previous run polled 1 or more messages. | false | false | MEDIUM
| *camel.source.endpoint.initialDelay* | Milliseconds before the first poll starts. | 1000L | false | MEDIUM
| *camel.source.endpoint.repeatCount* | Specifies a maximum limit of number of fires. So if you set it to 1, the scheduler will only fire once. If you set it to 5, it will only fire five times. A value of zero or negative means fire forever. | 0L | false | MEDIUM
