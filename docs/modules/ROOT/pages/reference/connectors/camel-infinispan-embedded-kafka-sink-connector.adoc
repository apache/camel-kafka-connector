Connector Description: Read and write from/to Infinispan distributed key/value store and data grid.

When using camel-infinispan-embedded-kafka-connector as sink make sure to use the following Maven dependency to have support for the connector:

[source,xml]
----
<dependency>
  <groupId>org.apache.camel.kafkaconnector</groupId>
  <artifactId>camel-infinispan-embedded-kafka-connector</artifactId>
  <version>x.x.x</version>
  <!-- use the same version as your Camel Kafka connector version -->
</dependency>
----

To use this Sink connector in Kafka connect you'll need to set the following connector.class

[source,java]
----
connector.class=org.apache.camel.kafkaconnector.infinispanembedded.CamelInfinispanembeddedSinkConnector
----


The camel-infinispan-embedded sink connector supports 29 options, which are listed below.



[width="100%",cols="2,5,^1,1,1",options="header"]
|===
| Name | Description | Default | Required | Priority
| *camel.sink.path.cacheName* | The name of the cache to use. Use current to use the existing cache name from the currently configured cached manager. Or use default for the default cache manager name. | null | true | HIGH
| *camel.sink.endpoint.queryBuilder* | Specifies the query builder. | null | false | MEDIUM
| *camel.sink.endpoint.defaultValue* | Set a specific default value for some producer operations | null | false | MEDIUM
| *camel.sink.endpoint.key* | Set a specific key for producer operations | null | false | MEDIUM
| *camel.sink.endpoint.lazyStartProducer* | Whether the producer should be started lazy (on the first message). By starting lazy you can use this to allow CamelContext and routes to startup in situations where a producer may otherwise fail during starting and cause the route to fail being started. By deferring this startup to be lazy then the startup failure can be handled during routing messages via Camel's routing error handlers. Beware that when the first message is processed then creating and starting the producer may take a little time and prolong the total processing time of the processing. | false | false | MEDIUM
| *camel.sink.endpoint.oldValue* | Set a specific old value for some producer operations | null | false | MEDIUM
| *camel.sink.endpoint.operation* | The operation to perform One of: [PUT] [PUTASYNC] [PUTALL] [PUTALLASYNC] [PUTIFABSENT] [PUTIFABSENTASYNC] [GET] [GETORDEFAULT] [CONTAINSKEY] [CONTAINSVALUE] [REMOVE] [REMOVEASYNC] [REPLACE] [REPLACEASYNC] [SIZE] [CLEAR] [CLEARASYNC] [QUERY] [STATS] [COMPUTE] [COMPUTEASYNC] | "PUT" | false | MEDIUM
| *camel.sink.endpoint.value* | Set a specific value for producer operations | null | false | MEDIUM
| *camel.sink.endpoint.cacheContainer* | Specifies the cache Container to connect | null | false | MEDIUM
| *camel.sink.endpoint.cacheContainerConfiguration* | The CacheContainer configuration. Used if the cacheContainer is not defined. | null | false | MEDIUM
| *camel.sink.endpoint.configurationUri* | An implementation specific URI for the CacheManager | null | false | MEDIUM
| *camel.sink.endpoint.flags* | A comma separated list of org.infinispan.context.Flag to be applied by default on each cache invocation | null | false | MEDIUM
| *camel.sink.endpoint.remappingFunction* | Set a specific remappingFunction to use in a compute operation. | null | false | MEDIUM
| *camel.sink.endpoint.resultHeader* | Store the operation result in a header instead of the message body. By default, resultHeader == null and the query result is stored in the message body, any existing content in the message body is discarded. If resultHeader is set, the value is used as the name of the header to store the query result and the original message body is preserved. This value can be overridden by an in message header named: CamelInfinispanOperationResultHeader | null | false | MEDIUM
| *camel.component.infinispan-embedded.configuration* | Component configuration | null | false | MEDIUM
| *camel.component.infinispan-embedded.queryBuilder* | Specifies the query builder. | null | false | MEDIUM
| *camel.component.infinispan-embedded.defaultValue* | Set a specific default value for some producer operations | null | false | MEDIUM
| *camel.component.infinispan-embedded.key* | Set a specific key for producer operations | null | false | MEDIUM

| *camel.component.infinispan-embedded.value* | Set a specific value for producer operations | null | false | MEDIUM
| *camel.component.infinispan-embedded.autowired Enabled* | Whether autowiring is enabled. This is used for automatic autowiring options (the option must be marked as autowired) by looking up in the registry to find if there is a single instance of matching type, which then gets configured on the component. This can be used for automatic configuring JDBC data sources, JMS connection factories, AWS Clients, etc. | true | false | MEDIUM
| *camel.component.infinispan-embedded.cacheContainer* | Specifies the cache Container to connect | null | false | MEDIUM
| *camel.component.infinispan-embedded.cacheContainer Configuration* | The CacheContainer configuration. Used if the cacheContainer is not defined. | null | false | MEDIUM
