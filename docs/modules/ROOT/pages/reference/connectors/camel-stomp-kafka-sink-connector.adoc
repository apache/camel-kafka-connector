Connector Description: Send and rececive messages to/from STOMP (Simple Text Oriented Messaging Protocol) compliant message brokers.

When using camel-stomp-kafka-connector as sink make sure to use the following Maven dependency to have support for the connector:

[source,xml]
----
<dependency>
  <groupId>org.apache.camel.kafkaconnector</groupId>
  <artifactId>camel-stomp-kafka-connector</artifactId>
  <version>x.x.x</version>
  <!-- use the same version as your Camel Kafka connector version -->
</dependency>
----

To use this Sink connector in Kafka connect you'll need to set the following connector.class

[source,java]
----
connector.class=org.apache.camel.kafkaconnector.stomp.CamelStompSinkConnector

[width="100%",cols="2,5,^1,1,1",options="header"]
|===
| Name | Description | Default | Required | Priority
| *camel.sink.path.destination* | Name of the queue | null | true | HIGH
| *camel.sink.endpoint.brokerURL* | The URI of the Stomp broker to connect to | "tcp://localhost:61613" | true | HIGH
| *camel.sink.endpoint.customHeaders* | To set custom headers | null | false | MEDIUM
| *camel.sink.endpoint.host* | The virtual host name | null | false | MEDIUM
| *camel.sink.endpoint.version* | The stomp version (1.1, or 1.2) | null | false | MEDIUM
| *camel.sink.endpoint.lazyStartProducer* | Whether the producer should be started lazy (on the first message). By starting lazy you can use this to allow CamelContext and routes to startup in situations where a producer may otherwise fail during starting and cause the route to fail being started. By deferring this startup to be lazy then the startup failure can be handled during routing messages via Camel's routing error handlers. Beware that when the first message is processed then creating and starting the producer may take a little time and prolong the total processing time of the processing. | false | false | MEDIUM
| *camel.sink.endpoint.headerFilterStrategy* | To use a custom HeaderFilterStrategy to filter header to and from Camel message. | null | false | MEDIUM
| *camel.sink.endpoint.login* | The username | null | false | MEDIUM
| *camel.sink.endpoint.passcode* | The password | null | false | MEDIUM
| *camel.sink.endpoint.sslContextParameters* | To configure security using SSLContextParameters | null | false | MEDIUM
| *camel.component.stomp.brokerURL* | The URI of the Stomp broker to connect to | "tcp://localhost:61613" | true | HIGH
| *camel.component.stomp.customHeaders* | To set custom headers | null | false | MEDIUM
| *camel.component.stomp.host* | The virtual host name | null | false | MEDIUM
| *camel.component.stomp.version* | The stomp version (1.1, or 1.2) | null | false | MEDIUM

By starting lazy you can use this to allow CamelContext and routes to startup in situations where a producer may otherwise fail during starting and cause the route to fail being started. By deferring this startup to be lazy then the startup failure can be handled during routing messages via Camel's routing error handlers. Beware that when the first message is processed then creating and starting the producer may take a little time and prolong the total processing time of the processing. | false | false | MEDIUM
| *camel.component.stomp.autowiredEnabled* | Whether autowiring is enabled. This is used for automatic autowiring options (the option must be marked as autowired) by looking up in the registry to find if there is a single instance of matching type, which then gets configured on the component. This can be used for automatic configuring JDBC data sources, JMS connection factories, AWS Clients, etc. | true | false | MEDIUM
| *camel.component.stomp.configuration* | Component configuration. | null | false | MEDIUM
| *camel.component.stomp.headerFilterStrategy* | To use a custom org.apache.camel.spi.HeaderFilterStrategy to filter header to and from Camel message. | null | false | MEDIUM
| *camel.component.stomp.login* | The username | null | false | MEDIUM
| *camel.component.stomp.passcode* | The password | null | false | MEDIUM
| *camel.component.stomp.sslContextParameters* | To configure security using SSLContextParameters | null | false | MEDIUM
| *camel.component.stomp.useGlobalSslContext Parameters* | Enable usage of global SSL context parameters. | false | false | MEDIUM
