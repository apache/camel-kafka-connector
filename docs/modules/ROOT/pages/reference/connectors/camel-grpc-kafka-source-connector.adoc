Connector description: Expose gRPC endpoints and access external gRPC endpoints.

When using camel-grpc-kafka-connector as source make sure to use the following Maven dependency to have support for the connector:

[source,xml]
----
<dependency>
  <groupId>org.apache.camel.kafkaconnector</groupId>
  <artifactId>camel-grpc-kafka-connector</artifactId>
  <version>x.x.x</version>
  <!-- use the same version as your Camel Kafka connector version -->
</dependency>
----

To use this Source connector in Kafka connect you'll need to set the following connector.class

[source,java]
----
connector.class=org.apache.camel.kafkaconnector.grpc.CamelGrpcSourceConnector
----


The camel-grpc source connector supports 28 options, which are listed below.



[width="100%",cols="2,5,^1,1,1",options="header"]
|===
| Name | Description | Default | Required | Priority
| *camel.source.path.host* | The gRPC server host name. This is localhost or 0.0.0.0 when being a consumer or remote server host name when using producer. | null | true | HIGH
| *camel.source.path.port* | The gRPC local or remote server port | null | true | HIGH
| *camel.source.path.service* | Fully qualified service name from the protocol buffer descriptor file (package dot service definition name) | null | true | HIGH
| *camel.source.endpoint.autoDiscoverClient Interceptors* | Setting the autoDiscoverClientInterceptors mechanism, if true, the component will look for a ClientInterceptor instance in the registry automatically otherwise it will skip that checking. | true | false | MEDIUM
| *camel.source.endpoint.flowControlWindow* | The HTTP/2 flow control window size (MiB) | 1048576 | false | MEDIUM
| *camel.source.endpoint.maxMessageSize* | The maximum message size allowed to be received/sent (MiB) | 4194304 | false | MEDIUM
| *camel.source.endpoint.bridgeErrorHandler* | Allows for bridging the consumer to the Camel routing Error Handler, which mean any exceptions occurred while the consumer is trying to pickup incoming messages, or the likes, will now be processed as a message and handled by the routing Error Handler. By default the consumer will use the org.apache.camel.spi.ExceptionHandler to deal with exceptions, that will be logged at WARN or ERROR level and ignored. | false | false | MEDIUM
| *camel.source.endpoint.consumerStrategy* | This option specifies the top-level strategy for processing service requests and responses in streaming mode. If an aggregation strategy is selected, all requests will be accumulated in the list, then transferred to the flow, and the accumulated responses will be sent to the sender. If a propagation strategy is selected, request is sent to the stream, and the response will be immediately sent back to the sender. One of: [AGGREGATION] [PROPAGATION] | "PROPAGATION" | false | MEDIUM
| *camel.source.endpoint.forwardOnCompleted* | Determines if onCompleted events should be pushed to the Camel route. | false | false | MEDIUM
| *camel.source.endpoint.forwardOnError* | Determines if onError events should be pushed to the Camel route. Exceptions will be set as message body. | false | false | MEDIUM
| *camel.source.endpoint.maxConcurrentCallsPer Connection* | The maximum number of concurrent calls permitted for each incoming server connection | 2147483647 | false | MEDIUM
| *camel.source.endpoint.routeControlledStream Observer* | Lets the route to take control over stream observer. If this value is set to true, then the response observer of gRPC call will be set with the name GrpcConstants.GRPC_RESPONSE_OBSERVER in the Exchange object. Please note that the stream observer's onNext(), onError(), onCompleted() methods should be called in the route. | false | false | MEDIUM
| *camel.source.endpoint.exceptionHandler* | To let the consumer use a custom ExceptionHandler. Notice if the option bridgeErrorHandler is enabled then this option is not in use. By default the consumer will deal with exceptions, that will be logged at WARN or ERROR level and ignored. | null | false | MEDIUM
| *camel.source.endpoint.exchangePattern* | Sets the exchange pattern when the consumer creates an exchange. One of: [InOnly] [InOut] [InOptionalOut] | null | false | MEDIUM
| *camel.source.endpoint.synchronous* | Sets whether synchronous processing should be strictly used | false | false | MEDIUM
| *camel.source.endpoint.authenticationType* | Authentication method type in advance to the SSL/TLS negotiation One of: [NONE] [GOOGLE] [JWT] | "NONE" | false | MEDIUM
| *camel.source.endpoint.jwtAlgorithm* | JSON Web Token sign algorithm One of: [HMAC256] [HMAC384] [HMAC512] | "HMAC256" | false | MEDIUM
| *camel.source.endpoint.jwtIssuer* | JSON Web Token issuer | null | false | MEDIUM
| *camel.source.endpoint.jwtSecret* | JSON Web Token secret | null | false | MEDIUM
| *camel.source.endpoint.jwtSubject* | JSON Web Token subject | null | false | MEDIUM
| *camel.source.endpoint.keyCertChainResource* | The X.509 certificate chain file resource in PEM format link | null | false | MEDIUM
| *camel.source.endpoint.keyPassword* | The PKCS#8 private key file password | null | false | MEDIUM
| *camel.source.endpoint.keyResource* | The PKCS#8 private key file resource in PEM format link | null | false | MEDIUM
| *camel.source.endpoint.negotiationType* | Identifies the security negotiation type used for HTTP/2 communication One of: [TLS] [PLAINTEXT_UPGRADE] [PLAINTEXT] | "PLAINTEXT" | false | MEDIUM
| *camel.source.endpoint.serviceAccountResource* | Service Account key file in JSON format resource link supported by the Google Cloud SDK | null | false | MEDIUM
| *camel.source.endpoint.trustCertCollectionResource* | The trusted certificates collection file resource in PEM format for verifying the remote endpoint's certificate | null | false | MEDIUM
| *camel.component.grpc.bridgeErrorHandler* | Allows for bridging the consumer to the Camel routing Error Handler, which mean any exceptions occurred while the consumer is trying to pickup incoming messages, or the likes, will now be processed as a message and handled by the routing Error Handler. By default the consumer will use the org.apache.camel.spi.ExceptionHandler to deal with exceptions, that will be logged at WARN or ERROR level and ignored. | false | false | MEDIUM
| *camel.component.grpc.autowiredEnabled* | Whether autowiring is enabled. This is used for automatic autowiring options (the option must be marked as autowired) by looking up in the registry to find if there is a single instance of matching type, which then gets configured on the component. This can be used for automatic configuring JDBC data sources, JMS connection factories, AWS Clients, etc. | true | false | MEDIUM
