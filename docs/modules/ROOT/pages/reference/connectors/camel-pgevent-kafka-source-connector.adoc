| Name | Description | Default | Required | Priority
| *camel.source.path.host* | To connect using hostname and port to the database. | "localhost" | false | MEDIUM
| *camel.source.path.port* | To connect using hostname and port to the database. | "5432" | false | MEDIUM
| *camel.source.path.database* | The database name. The database name can take any characters because it is sent as a quoted identifier. It is part of the endpoint URI, so diacritical marks and non-Latin letters have to be URL encoded. | null | true | HIGH
| *camel.source.path.channel* | The channel name | null | true | HIGH
| *camel.source.endpoint.datasource* | To connect using the given javax.sql.DataSource instead of using hostname and port. | null | false | MEDIUM
| *camel.source.endpoint.bridgeErrorHandler* | Allows for bridging the consumer to the Camel routing Error Handler, which mean any exceptions occurred while the consumer is trying to pickup incoming messages, or the likes, will now be processed as a message and handled by the routing Error Handler. By default the consumer will use the org.apache.camel.spi.ExceptionHandler to deal with exceptions, that will be logged at WARN or ERROR level and ignored. | false | false | MEDIUM
| *camel.source.endpoint.exceptionHandler* | To let the consumer use a custom ExceptionHandler. Notice if the option bridgeErrorHandler is enabled then this option is not in use. By default the consumer will deal with exceptions, that will be logged at WARN or ERROR level and ignored. | null | false | MEDIUM

| *camel.component.pgevent.bridgeErrorHandler* | Allows for bridging the consumer to the Camel routing Error Handler, which mean any exceptions occurred while the consumer is trying to pickup incoming messages, or the likes, will now be processed as a message and handled by the routing Error Handler. By default the consumer will use the org.apache.camel.spi.ExceptionHandler to deal with exceptions, that will be logged at WARN or ERROR level and ignored. | false | false | MEDIUM
| *camel.component.pgevent.autowiredEnabled* | Whether autowiring is enabled. This is used for automatic autowiring options (the option must be marked as autowired) by looking up in the registry to find if there is a single instance of matching type, which then gets configured on the component. This can be used for automatic configuring JDBC data sources, JMS connection factories, AWS Clients, etc. | true | false | MEDIUM
