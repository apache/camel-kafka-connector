= camel-cxfrs-kafka-connector sink configuration

Connector Description: Expose JAX-RS REST services using Apache CXF or connect to external REST services using CXF REST client.

When using camel-cxfrs-kafka-connector as sink make sure to use the following Maven dependency to have support for the connector:

[source,xml]
----
<dependency>
  <groupId>org.apache.camel.kafkaconnector</groupId>
  <artifactId>camel-cxfrs-kafka-connector</artifactId>
  <version>x.x.x</version>
  <!-- use the same version as your Camel Kafka connector version -->
</dependency>
----

To use this Sink connector in Kafka connect you'll need to set the following connector.class

[source,java]
----
connector.class=org.apache.camel.kafkaconnector.cxfrs.CamelCxfrsSinkConnector
----


The camel-cxfrs sink connector supports 31 options, which are listed below.



[width="100%",cols="2,5,^1,1,1",options="header"]
|===
| Name | Description | Default | Required | Priority
| *camel.sink.path.beanId* | To lookup an existing configured CxfRsEndpoint. Must used bean: as prefix. | null | false | MEDIUM
| *camel.sink.path.address* | The service publish address. | null | false | MEDIUM
| *camel.sink.endpoint.features* | Set the feature list to the CxfRs endpoint. | null | false | MEDIUM
| *camel.sink.endpoint.loggingFeatureEnabled* | This option enables CXF Logging Feature which writes inbound and outbound REST messages to log. | false | false | MEDIUM
| *camel.sink.endpoint.loggingSizeLimit* | To limit the total size of number of bytes the logger will output when logging feature has been enabled. | null | false | MEDIUM
| *camel.sink.endpoint.modelRef* | This option is used to specify the model file which is useful for the resource class without annotation. When using this option, then the service class can be omitted, to emulate document-only endpoints | null | false | MEDIUM
| *camel.sink.endpoint.providers* | Set custom JAX-RS provider(s) list to the CxfRs endpoint. You can specify a string with a list of providers to lookup in the registy separated by comma. | null | false | MEDIUM
| *camel.sink.endpoint.resourceClasses* | The resource classes which you want to export as REST service. Multiple classes can be separated by comma. | null | false | MEDIUM
| *camel.sink.endpoint.schemaLocations* | Sets the locations of the schema(s) which can be used to validate the incoming XML or JAXB-driven JSON. | null | false | MEDIUM
| *camel.sink.endpoint.skipFaultLogging* | This option controls whether the PhaseInterceptorChain skips logging the Fault that it catches. | false | false | MEDIUM
| *camel.sink.endpoint.cookieHandler* | Configure a cookie handler to maintain a HTTP session | null | false | MEDIUM
| *camel.sink.endpoint.hostnameVerifier* | The hostname verifier to be used. Use the # notation to reference a HostnameVerifier from the registry. | null | false | MEDIUM
| *camel.sink.endpoint.lazyStartProducer* | Whether the producer should be started lazy (on the first message). By starting lazy you can use this to allow CamelContext and routes to startup in situations where a producer may otherwise fail during starting and cause the route to fail being started. By deferring this startup to be lazy then the startup failure can be handled during routing messages via Camel's routing error handlers. Beware that when the first message is processed then creating and starting the producer may take a little time and prolong the total processing time of the processing. | false | false | MEDIUM
| *camel.sink.endpoint.sslContextParameters* | The Camel SSL setting reference. Use the # notation to reference the SSL Context. | null | false | MEDIUM
| *camel.sink.endpoint.throwExceptionOnFailure* | This option tells the CxfRsProducer to inspect return codes and will generate an Exception if the return code is larger than 207. | true | false | MEDIUM
| *camel.sink.endpoint.httpClientAPI* | If it is true, the CxfRsProducer will use the HttpClientAPI to invoke the service. If it is false, the CxfRsProducer will use the ProxyClientAPI to invoke the service | true | false | MEDIUM
| *camel.sink.endpoint.ignoreDeleteMethodMessageBody* | This option is used to tell CxfRsProducer to ignore the message body of the DELETE method when using HTTP API. | false | false | MEDIUM
| *camel.sink.endpoint.maxClientCacheSize* | This option allows you to configure the maximum size of the cache. The implementation caches CXF clients or ClientFactoryBean in CxfProvider and CxfRsProvider. | 10 | false | MEDIUM
| *camel.sink.endpoint.synchronous* | Sets whether synchronous processing should be strictly used | false | false | MEDIUM
| *camel.sink.endpoint.binding* | To use a custom CxfBinding to control the binding between Camel Message and CXF Message. | null | false | MEDIUM
| *camel.sink.endpoint.bus* | To use a custom configured CXF Bus. | null | false | MEDIUM
| *camel.sink.endpoint.continuationTimeout* | This option is used to set the CXF continuation timeout which could be used in CxfConsumer by default when the CXF server is using Jetty or Servlet transport. | 30000L | false | MEDIUM
| *camel.sink.endpoint.cxfRsConfigurer* | This option could apply the implementation of org.apache.camel.component.cxf.jaxrs.CxfRsEndpointConfigurer which supports to configure the CXF endpoint in programmatic way. User can configure the CXF server and client by implementing configure{Server/Client} method of CxfEndpointConfigurer. | null | false | MEDIUM
| *camel.sink.endpoint.defaultBus* | Will set the default bus when CXF endpoint create a bus by itself | false | false | MEDIUM
| *camel.sink.endpoint.headerFilterStrategy* | To use a custom HeaderFilterStrategy to filter header to and from Camel message. | null | false | MEDIUM
| *camel.sink.endpoint.performInvocation* | When the option is true, Camel will perform the invocation of the resource class instance and put the response object into the exchange for further processing. | false | false | MEDIUM
| *camel.sink.endpoint.propagateContexts* | When the option is true, JAXRS UriInfo, HttpHeaders, Request and SecurityContext contexts will be available to custom CXFRS processors as typed Camel exchange properties. These contexts can be used to analyze the current requests using JAX-RS API. | false | false | MEDIUM
| *camel.component.cxfrs.lazyStartProducer* | Whether the producer should be started lazy (on the first message). By starting lazy you can use this to allow CamelContext and routes to startup in situations where a producer may otherwise fail during starting and cause the route to fail being started. By deferring this startup to be lazy then the startup failure can be handled during routing messages via Camel's routing error handlers. Beware that when the first message is processed then creating and starting the producer may take a little time and prolong the total processing time of the processing. | false | false | MEDIUM
| *camel.component.cxfrs.autowiredEnabled* | Whether autowiring is enabled. This is used for automatic autowiring options (the option must be marked as autowired) by looking up in the registry to find if there is a single instance of matching type, which then gets configured on the component. This can be used for automatic configuring JDBC data sources, JMS connection factories, AWS Clients, etc. | true | false | MEDIUM
| *camel.component.cxfrs.headerFilterStrategy* | To use a custom org.apache.camel.spi.HeaderFilterStrategy to filter header to and from Camel message. | null | false | MEDIUM
| *camel.component.cxfrs.useGlobalSslContext Parameters* | Enable usage of global SSL context parameters. | false | false | MEDIUM
