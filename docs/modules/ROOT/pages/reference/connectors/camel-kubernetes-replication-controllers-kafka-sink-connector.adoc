Connector Description: Perform operations on Kubernetes Replication Controllers and get notified on Replication Controllers changes.

When using camel-kubernetes-replication-controllers-kafka-connector as sink make sure to use the following Maven dependency to have support for the connector:

[source,xml]
----
<dependency>
  <groupId>org.apache.camel.kafkaconnector</groupId>
  <artifactId>camel-kubernetes-replication-controllers-kafka-connector</artifactId>
  <version>x.x.x</version>
  <!-- use the same version as your Camel Kafka connector version -->
</dependency>
----

To use this Sink connector in Kafka connect you'll need to set the following connector.class

[source,java]
----
connector.class=org.apache.camel.kafkaconnector.kubernetesreplicationcontrollers.CamelKubernetesreplicationcontrollersSinkConnector
----


The camel-kubernetes-replication-controllers sink connector supports 23 options, which are listed below.



[width="100%",cols="2,5,^1,1,1",options="header"]
|===
| Name | Description | Default | Required | Priority
| *camel.sink.path.masterUrl* | Kubernetes Master url | null | true | HIGH
| *camel.sink.endpoint.apiVersion* | The Kubernetes API Version to use | null | false | MEDIUM
| *camel.sink.endpoint.dnsDomain* | The dns domain, used for ServiceCall EIP | null | false | MEDIUM
| *camel.sink.endpoint.kubernetesClient* | Default KubernetesClient to use if provided | null | false | MEDIUM
| *camel.sink.endpoint.portName* | The port name, used for ServiceCall EIP | null | false | MEDIUM
| *camel.sink.endpoint.portProtocol* | The port protocol, used for ServiceCall EIP | "tcp" | false | MEDIUM
| *camel.sink.endpoint.lazyStartProducer* | Whether the producer should be started lazy (on the first message). By starting lazy you can use this to allow CamelContext and routes to startup in situations where a producer may otherwise fail during starting and cause the route to fail being started. By deferring this startup to be lazy then the startup failure can be handled during routing messages via Camel's routing error handlers. Beware that when the first message is processed then creating and starting the producer may take a little time and prolong the total processing time of the processing. | false | false | MEDIUM
| *camel.sink.endpoint.operation* | Producer operation to do on Kubernetes | null | false | MEDIUM
| *camel.sink.endpoint.connectionTimeout* | Connection timeout in milliseconds to use when making requests to the Kubernetes API server. | null | false | MEDIUM
| *camel.sink.endpoint.caCertData* | The CA Cert Data | null | false | MEDIUM
| *camel.sink.endpoint.caCertFile* | The CA Cert File | null | false | MEDIUM
| *camel.sink.endpoint.clientCertData* | The Client Cert Data | null | false | MEDIUM
| *camel.sink.endpoint.clientCertFile* | The Client Cert File | null | false | MEDIUM
| *camel.sink.endpoint.clientKeyAlgo* | The Key Algorithm used by the client | null | false | MEDIUM
| *camel.sink.endpoint.clientKeyData* | The Client Key data | null | false | MEDIUM
| *camel.sink.endpoint.clientKeyFile* | The Client Key file | null | false | MEDIUM
| *camel.sink.endpoint.clientKeyPassphrase* | The Client Key Passphrase | null | false | MEDIUM
| *camel.sink.endpoint.oauthToken* | The Auth Token | null | false | MEDIUM
| *camel.sink.endpoint.password* | Password to connect to Kubernetes | null | false | MEDIUM
| *camel.sink.endpoint.trustCerts* | Define if the certs we used are trusted anyway or not | null | false | MEDIUM
| *camel.sink.endpoint.username* | Username to connect to Kubernetes | null | false | MEDIUM
| * camel.component.kubernetes-replication-controllers.lazy StartProducer* | Whether the producer should be started lazy (on the first message). By starting lazy you can use this to allow CamelContext and routes to startup in situations where a producer may otherwise fail during starting and cause the route to fail being started. By deferring this startup to be lazy then the startup failure can be handled during routing messages via Camel's routing error handlers. Beware that when the first message is processed then creating and starting the producer may take a little time and prolong the total processing time of the processing. | false | false | MEDIUM
| * camel.component.kubernetes-replication-controllers.autowired Enabled* | Whether autowiring is enabled. This is used for automatic autowiring options (the option must be marked as autowired) by looking up in the registry to find if there is a single instance of matching type, which then gets configured on the component. This can be used for automatic configuring JDBC data sources, JMS connection factories, AWS Clients, etc. | true | false | MEDIUM
