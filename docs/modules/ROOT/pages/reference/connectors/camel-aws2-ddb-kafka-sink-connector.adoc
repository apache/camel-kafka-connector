|===
| Name | Description | Default | Required | Priority
| *camel.sink.path.tableName* | The name of the table currently worked with. | null | true | HIGH
| *camel.sink.endpoint.amazonDDBClient* | To use the AmazonDynamoDB as the client | null | false | MEDIUM
| *camel.sink.endpoint.consistentRead* | Determines whether or not strong consistency should be enforced when data is read. | false | false | MEDIUM
| *camel.sink.endpoint.keyAttributeName* | Attribute name when creating table | null | false | MEDIUM

| *camel.sink.endpoint.keyScalarType* | The key scalar type, it can be S (String), N (Number) and B (Bytes) | null | false | MEDIUM
| *camel.sink.endpoint.lazyStartProducer* | Whether the producer should be started lazy (on the first message). By starting lazy you can use this to allow CamelContext and routes to startup in situations where a producer may otherwise fail during starting and cause the route to fail being started. By deferring this startup to be lazy then the startup failure can be handled during routing messages via Camel's routing error handlers. Beware that when the first message is processed then creating and starting the producer may take a little time and prolong the total processing time of the processing. | false | false | MEDIUM

| *camel.sink.endpoint.overrideEndpoint* | Set the need for overidding the endpoint. This option needs to be used in combination with uriEndpointOverride option | false | false | MEDIUM
| *camel.sink.endpoint.proxyHost* | To define a proxy host when instantiating the DDB client | null | false | MEDIUM
| *camel.sink.endpoint.proxyPort* | The region in which DynamoDB client needs to work. When using this parameter, the configuration will expect the lowercase name of the region (for example ap-east-1) You'll need to use the name Region.EU_WEST_1.id() | null | false | MEDIUM

| *camel.sink.endpoint.useDefaultCredentialsProvider* | Set whether the S3 client should expect to load credentials through a default credentials provider or to expect static credentials to be passed in. | false | false | MEDIUM

This is used for automatic autowiring options (the option must be marked as autowired) by looking up in the registry to find if there is a single instance of matching type, which then gets configured on the component.
