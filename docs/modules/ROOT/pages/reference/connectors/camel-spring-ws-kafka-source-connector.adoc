Connector description: Access external web services as a client or expose your own web services.

When using camel-spring-ws-kafka-connector as source make sure to use the following Maven dependency to have support for the connector:

[source,xml]
----
<dependency>
  <groupId>org.apache.camel.kafkaconnector</groupId>
  <artifactId>camel-spring-ws-kafka-connector</artifactId>
  <version>x.x.x</version>
  <!-- use the same version as your Camel Kafka connector version -->
</dependency>
----

To use this Source connector in Kafka connect you'll need to set the following connector.class

[source,java]
----
connector.class=org.apache.camel.kafkaconnector.springws.CamelSpringwsSourceConnector
----


The camel-spring-ws source connector supports 14 options, which are listed below.



[width="100%",cols="2,5,^1,1,1",options="header"]
|===
| Name | Description | Default | Required | Priority
| *camel.source.path.type* | Endpoint mapping type if endpoint mapping is used. rootqname - Offers the option to map web service requests based on the qualified name of the root element contained in the message. soapaction - Used to map web service requests based on the SOAP action specified in the header of the message. uri - In order to map web service requests that target a specific URI. xpathresult - Used to map web service requests based on the evaluation of an XPath expression against the incoming message. The result of the evaluation should match the XPath result specified in the endpoint URI. beanname - Allows you to reference an org.apache.camel.component.spring.ws.bean.CamelEndpointDispatcher object in order to integrate with existing (legacy) endpoint mappings like PayloadRootQNameEndpointMapping, SoapActionEndpointMapping, etc One of: [ROOT_QNAME] [ACTION] [TO] [SOAP_ACTION] [XPATHRESULT] [URI] [URI_PATH] [BEANNAME] | null | false | MEDIUM
| *camel.source.path.lookupKey* | Endpoint mapping key if endpoint mapping is used | null | false | MEDIUM
| *camel.source.path.expression* | The XPath expression to use when option type=xpathresult. Then this option is required to be configured. | null | false | MEDIUM
| *camel.source.endpoint.messageFilter* | Option to provide a custom MessageFilter. For example when you want to process your headers or attachments by your own. | null | false | MEDIUM
| *camel.source.endpoint.messageIdStrategy* | Option to provide a custom MessageIdStrategy to control generation of WS-Addressing unique message ids. | null | false | MEDIUM
| *camel.source.endpoint.bridgeErrorHandler* | Allows for bridging the consumer to the Camel routing Error Handler, which mean any exceptions occurred while the consumer is trying to pickup incoming messages, or the likes, will now be processed as a message and handled by the routing Error Handler. By default the consumer will use the org.apache.camel.spi.ExceptionHandler to deal with exceptions, that will be logged at WARN or ERROR level and ignored. | false | false | MEDIUM
| *camel.source.endpoint.endpointDispatcher* | Spring org.springframework.ws.server.endpoint.MessageEndpoint for dispatching messages received by Spring-WS to a Camel endpoint, to integrate with existing (legacy) endpoint mappings like PayloadRootQNameEndpointMapping, SoapActionEndpointMapping, etc. | null | false | MEDIUM
| *camel.source.endpoint.endpointMapping* | Reference to an instance of org.apache.camel.component.spring.ws.bean.CamelEndpointMapping in the Registry/ApplicationContext. Only one bean is required in the registry to serve all Camel/Spring-WS endpoints. This bean is auto-discovered by the MessageDispatcher and used to map requests to Camel endpoints based on characteristics specified on the endpoint (like root QName, SOAP action, etc) | null | false | MEDIUM
| *camel.source.endpoint.exceptionHandler* | To let the consumer use a custom ExceptionHandler. Notice if the option bridgeErrorHandler is enabled then this option is not in use. By default the consumer will deal with exceptions, that will be logged at WARN or ERROR level and ignored. | null | false | MEDIUM
| *camel.source.endpoint.exchangePattern* | Sets the exchange pattern when the consumer creates an exchange. One of: [InOnly] [InOut] [InOptionalOut] | null | false | MEDIUM
| *camel.source.endpoint.sslContextParameters* | To configure security using SSLContextParameters | null | false | MEDIUM
| *camel.component.spring-ws.bridgeErrorHandler* | Allows for bridging the consumer to the Camel routing Error Handler, which mean any exceptions occurred while the consumer is trying to pickup incoming messages, or the likes, will now be processed as a message and handled by the routing Error Handler. By default the consumer will use the org.apache.camel.spi.ExceptionHandler to deal with exceptions, that will be logged at WARN or ERROR level and ignored. | false | false | MEDIUM
| *camel.component.spring-ws.autowiredEnabled* | Whether autowiring is enabled. This is used for automatic autowiring options (the option must be marked as autowired) by looking up in the registry to find if there is a single instance of matching type, which then gets configured on the component. This can be used for automatic configuring JDBC data sources, JMS connection factories, AWS Clients, etc. | true | false | MEDIUM
| *camel.component.spring-ws.useGlobalSslContext Parameters* | Enable usage of global SSL context parameters. | false | false | MEDIUM
