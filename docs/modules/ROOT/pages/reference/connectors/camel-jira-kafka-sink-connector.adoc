[width="100%",cols="2,5,^1,1,1",options="header"]
|===
| Name | Description | Default | Required | Priority
| *camel.sink.path.type* | Operation to perform. Consumers: NewIssues, NewComments. Producers: AddIssue, AttachFile, DeleteIssue, TransitionIssue, UpdateIssue, Watchers. See this class javadoc description for more information. One of: [ADDCOMMENT] [ADDISSUE] [ATTACH] [DELETEISSUE] [NEWISSUES] [NEWCOMMENTS] [WATCHUPDATES] [UPDATEISSUE] [TRANSITIONISSUE] [WATCHERS] [ADDISSUELINK] [ADDWORKLOG] [FETCHISSUE] [FETCHCOMMENTS] | null | true | HIGH
| *camel.sink.endpoint.delay* | Time in milliseconds to elapse for the next poll. | "6000" | false | MEDIUM
| *camel.sink.endpoint.jiraUrl* | The Jira server url, example: \http://my_jira.com:8081 | null | true | HIGH
| *camel.sink.endpoint.lazyStartProducer* | Whether the producer should be started lazy (on the first message). By starting lazy you can use this to allow CamelContext and routes to startup in situations where a producer may otherwise fail during starting and cause the route to fail being started. By deferring this startup to be lazy then the startup failure can be handled during routing messages via Camel's routing error handlers. Beware that when the first message is processed then creating and starting the producer may take a little time and prolong the total processing time of the processing. | false | false | MEDIUM
| *camel.sink.endpoint.accessToken* | (OAuth only) The access token generated by the Jira server. | null | false | MEDIUM
| *camel.sink.endpoint.consumerKey* | (OAuth only) The consumer key from Jira settings. | null | false | MEDIUM
| *camel.sink.endpoint.password* | (Basic authentication only) The password to authenticate to the Jira server. Use only if username basic authentication is used. | null | false | MEDIUM
| *camel.sink.endpoint.privateKey* | (OAuth only) The private key generated by the client to encrypt the conversation to the server. | null | false | MEDIUM
| *camel.sink.endpoint.username* | (Basic authentication only) The username to authenticate to the Jira server. Use only if OAuth is not enabled on the Jira server. Do not set the username and OAuth token parameter, if they are both set, the username basic authentication takes precedence. | null | false | MEDIUM
| *camel.sink.endpoint.verificationCode* | (OAuth only) The verification code from Jira generated in the first step of the authorization proccess. | null | false | MEDIUM
| *camel.component.jira.delay* | Time in milliseconds to elapse for the next poll. | "6000" | false | MEDIUM
| *camel.component.jira.jiraUrl* | The Jira server url, example: \http://my_jira.com:8081 | null | true | HIGH
| *camel.component.jira.lazyStartProducer* | Whether the producer should be started lazy (on the first message). By starting lazy you can use this to allow CamelContext and routes to startup in situations where a producer may otherwise fail during starting and cause the route to fail being started. By deferring this startup to be lazy then the startup failure can be handled during routing messages via Camel's routing error handlers. Beware that when the first message is processed then creating and starting the producer may take a little time and prolong the total processing time of the processing. | false | false | MEDIUM
| *camel.component.jira.autowiredEnabled* | Whether autowiring is enabled. This is used for automatic autowiring options (the option must be marked as autowired) by looking up in the registry to find if there is a single instance of matching type, which then gets configured on the component. This can be used for automatic configuring JDBC data sources, JMS connection factories, AWS Clients, etc. | true | false | MEDIUM
| *camel.component.jira.configuration* | To use a shared base jira configuration. | null | false | MEDIUM
| *camel.component.jira.accessToken* | (OAuth only) The access token generated by the Jira server. | null | false | MEDIUM
| *camel.component.jira.consumerKey* | (OAuth only) The consumer key from Jira settings. | null | false | MEDIUM
