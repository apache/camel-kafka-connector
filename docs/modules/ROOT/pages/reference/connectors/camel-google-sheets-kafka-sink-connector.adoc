|===
| Name | Description | Default | Required | Priority
| *camel.sink.path.apiName* | What kind of operation to perform One of: [SPREADSHEETS] [DATA] | null | true | HIGH
| *camel.sink.path.methodName* | What sub operation to use for the selected operation One of: [create] [get] [update] [append] [batchUpdate] [clear] | null | true | HIGH
| *camel.sink.endpoint.applicationName* | Google Sheets application name. Example would be camel-google-sheets/1.0 | null | false | MEDIUM
| *camel.sink.endpoint.clientId* | Client ID of the sheets application | null | false | MEDIUM
| *camel.sink.endpoint.inBody* | Sets the name of a parameter to be passed in the exchange In Body | null | false | MEDIUM
| *camel.sink.endpoint.lazyStartProducer* | Whether the producer should be started lazy (on the first message). By starting lazy you can use this to allow CamelContext and routes to startup in situations where a producer may otherwise fail during starting and cause the route to fail being started. By deferring this startup to be lazy then the startup failure can be handled during routing messages via Camel's routing error handlers. Beware that when the first message is processed then creating and starting the producer may take a little time and prolong the total processing time of the processing. | false | false | MEDIUM
| *camel.sink.endpoint.accessToken* | OAuth 2 access token. This typically expires after an hour so refreshToken is recommended for long term usage. | null | false | MEDIUM
| *camel.sink.endpoint.clientSecret* | Client secret of the sheets application | null | false | MEDIUM
| *camel.sink.endpoint.refreshToken* | OAuth 2 refresh token. Using this, the Google Sheets component can obtain a new accessToken whenever the current one expires - a necessity if the application is long-lived. | null | false | MEDIUM
| *camel.component.google-sheets.applicationName* | Google Sheets application name. Example would be camel-google-sheets/1.0 | null | false | MEDIUM
| *camel.component.google-sheets.clientId* | Client ID of the sheets application | null | false | MEDIUM
| *camel.component.google-sheets.configuration* | To use the shared configuration | null | false | MEDIUM
| *camel.component.google-sheets.lazyStartProducer* | Whether the producer should be started lazy (on the first message). By starting lazy you can use this to allow CamelContext and routes to startup in situations where a producer may otherwise fail during starting and cause the route to fail being started. By deferring this startup to be lazy then the startup failure can be handled during routing messages via Camel's routing error handlers. Beware that when the first message is processed then creating and starting the producer may take a little time and prolong the total processing time of the processing. | false | false | MEDIUM
| *camel.component.google-sheets.autowiredEnabled* | Whether autowiring is enabled. This is used for automatic autowiring options (the option must be marked as autowired) by looking up in the registry to find if there is a single instance of matching type, which then gets configured on the component. This can be used for automatic configuring JDBC data sources, JMS connection factories, AWS Clients, etc. | true | false | MEDIUM
| *camel.component.google-sheets.clientFactory* | To use the GoogleSheetsClientFactory as factory for creating the client. Will by default use BatchGoogleSheetsClientFactory | null | false | MEDIUM
| *camel.component.google-sheets.accessToken* | OAuth 2 access token. This typically expires after an hour so refreshToken is recommended for long term usage. | null | false | MEDIUM
| *camel.component.google-sheets.clientSecret* | Client secret of the sheets application | null | false | MEDIUM
| *camel.component.google-sheets.refreshToken* | OAuth 2 refresh token. Using this, the Google Sheets component can obtain a new accessToken whenever the current one expires - a necessity if the application is long-lived. | null | false | MEDIUM
