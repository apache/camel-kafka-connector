[#connector-not-loaded]
== Kafka Connect does not load the Camel connector

If the Kafka Connect runtime is not loading the Camel connector, the cause could be an incorrect directory
structure. There is a specific directory structure that needs to be followed when installing the connectors.
They are meant to be installed in a subdirectory of the Kafka Connect https://kafka.apache.org/documentation/#plugin.path[plugin.path]
and every connector should be within its own directory.

For example, if you have set the value of `plugin.path` to `/camel-kafka-connectors/` then every connector should
be within a directory inside it:

* `/camel-kafka-connectors/camel-<component>-kafka-connector`

It's possible to have multiple connectors in the `plugin.path`, therefore in a setup with both `amqp` and `hdfs`
connectors, it would be possible to have a directory structure like this:

* `/camel-kafka-connectors/camel-hdfs-kafka-connector`
* `/camel-kafka-connectors/camel-amqp-kafka-connector`

[#missing-or-incorrect-converters]
== Missing or Incorrect Converters

A common root cause for Kafka Connect failing to serialize or deserialize the data in transit is incorrect values
for the https://kafka.apache.org/documentation/#key.converter[key.converter] or the
https://kafka.apache.org/documentation/#value.converter[value.converter] (or both). There are usually verifiable
in the logs by looking for `Caused by: org.apache.kafka.common.errors.SerializationException` or
`Caused by: org.apache.kafka.connect.errors.DataException`.

Here's one example with trying to exchange data using the AMQP connector without setting the `key.converter` and
`value.converter` correctly:

`Caused by: org.apache.kafka.connect.errors.DataException: JsonConverter with schemas.enable requires "schema" and "payload" fields and may not contain additional fields. If you are trying to deserialize plain JSON data, set schemas.enable=false in your converter configuration.`

[#missing-dependencies]
== Missing Dependencies

When deploying the connector manually (ie.: without the assistance of tools such as Strimzi) you may need to
make sure to provide the required runtime dependencies and their dependencies. Some notable examples are:

* AMQP connector requires a JMS-compliant client (such as qpid-jms-client)
* From version 0.7.0 onward, the ActiveMQ and Artemis JMS clients are packaged along with the SJMS2 connector.
If you need to use other JMS clients, then you have to repackage including all required libraries.
* JDBC connector requires the JDBC client for the database

[#known-incompatibilities]
== Known Incompatibilities

* Do not use activemq-all 5.16.0 or older with the SJMS2 connector: the activemq-all jar contains packages older
versions of Camel that cause conflict when trying to run the connector. You may find very interesting errors such as
`java.lang.NoSuchMethodError: org.apache.camel.main.Main.configure()Lorg/apache/camel/main/MainConfigurationProperties`
when trying to do so.
