= Getting started with packages

The Camel-Kafka-connector connectors can be used also as packages to unpack in your Kafka-connect Plugin path.

If you already set up Zookeeper, Kafka, and Kafka Connect, using camel-kafka-connector's connector is pretty fast: you can download one or more archives (we provide zip and tar.gz formats) and extract their content into the Kafka Connect environment, specifically in Kafka Connectâ€™s plugin path. Doing this will require to specify the plugin path in your worker configuration (e.g. connect-distributed.properties or connect-standalone.properties) using the plugin.path configuration property. 

We're still under heavy development and we'll do a first release soon, for the moment you could obtain the packages through building the project.
