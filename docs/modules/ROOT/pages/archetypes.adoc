[[Archetypes-Archetypes]]
= Archetypes

There are scenarios in Camel-Kafka-connector and in the Kafka Connect world in general, where an end users needs to extend a connector by adding, for example, a converter or a transformer (or in the camel-kafka-connector case an aggregator).

In camel-kafka-connector we provide multiple archetypes for this purpose.
